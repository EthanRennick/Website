        <p>Anna cradled her rifle as she leaned out of a second floor window of her café. She was a poor shot with the thing, and preferred being up close and personnal with the blunderbuss they had fashioned. Her café, Anna's Place, looked like a fortress. What was once a hardware store with a small café was now the team's base of operations; With all the armour, defences and traps to boot.
            She scanned the horizon. Newly planted trees were sprouting up quickly. There wasn't a bird or animal in sight. The courtyard outside her store was a battlefield. Corpses of several undead that had attacked during the night lay strewn about the place. The moat they had built was damaged when the last horde swept through the area. Zombies that wandered past could clamber through the moat and into Anna's Place. When one staggered past, she would wait to see if it entered the yard. Perhaps the spikes or barbs in the moat would take care of it. She didn't want to waste her ammunition.
        </p>
        <p>Atlas and Boldrick were out scavenging. Atlas was an older gentleman, maybe in his early sixties. He never opened up much about his past, but Anna gathered that he was ex-military. The man was quick with a pistol. He had bravery that she had never seen. When a horde swept through, he was always in the thick of it - Fighting to save his comrades as he had done before. Boldrick was a lighter fellow. Anna didn't know if it was the outbreak of the virus which had broke him or if he had broken out of some institution during the initial chaos. He liked guns. He liked big guns the most. Whatever was loaded and firing, he wanted in on it. He carried around a heavy machinegun which he used to swiftly exterminate any threat he came across. The man was younger than Atlas but was jittery. Atlas often urged Anna to accompany him on scavenging trips. Atlas could survive on his own. But Anna and Boldrick worked best in a team.</p>

        <p>Anna watched from her window perch as several more undead wandered through the woods. They didn't show any interest in her or her café. She suspected that the stench of the rotting ones outside was masking her activities indoors. While she wasn't on watch, she was carefully preparing some ready meals for the team to take out with them on their next excursion. Canned goods were plentiful but finite. She had assisted in the construction of a makeshift hydroponics area. The room which led from the workshop to the outdoor eating area had been converted into this greenhouse and provided ample fruits and vegetables for the team, including some beans for coffee or herbal plants for improvised medicine. She also kept an eye on the brass that was melting down in the small furnace by her feet. The gambling addiction of the owner of the old hardware place downstairs lended itself nicely to the brass collection process when Atlas discovered a great deal of the chips and casino medals he collected were in fact brass. An ample supply of this brass and an ample supply of nitre from a local 18th century mine meant the group could manufacture substitute ammunition for their weapons. This in turn contributed to their ability to clear infected buildings and collect supplies which gave them a higher chance of survival; And the cycle continued.</p>
        <p>A whirring in the distance caught Anna's ear. She hadn't seen another soul on these roads except her two friends. Not since she took the trip North to the cities and found her sister's beauty salon in ruins with raiders in sniper positions in surrounding skyscrapers had she held hope of finding anyone else in the world who hadn't been so abused by the outbreak that they were still sociable. It was in fact the whirring of Atlas' motorcycle. He had built it himself out of parts he had found. Anna abandoned her perch and clambered down the ladder to the now uninhabited ground floor. The room was full of generators which while operational powered several machines in the room which rotated blades at high speeds with the intent to kill a zombie that had broken in. She raced to the front and pushed open the heavy metal door leading to the courtyard. She walked past the corpses impaled on spikes and those caught in barbed wire and worked her way towards the draw bridge. She pulled at the mechanism which shifted the drawbridge's lowering system and the drawbridge came to a stop creating a path over the moat. Atlas eventually came into view and was moving with alarming speed. Anna darted to the side as Atlas thundered across the bridge and brought the bike to a screeching halt, causing several of the passing zombies to turn their heads and shuffle aimlessly towards the yard.</p>
        <p>"What on Earth's the rush, you'll wake the damn dead" Anna asked, not in a panic but with a great deal of worry.<br>
        "The dead are on their way.." Atlas uttered, setting his bike stand and hopping quickly off. "They're coming Anna.. A horde bigger than one we've faced yet.."<br>
        "That's impossible, Gramps, I've seen no sign of one. We just defeated this one last night, it's going to be at least a week before the next comes by!" Anna desperately said, trying to reassure herself and Atlas combined.<br>
        "No, no.." Atlass muttered almost in a daze. "Boldrick stayed behind to see how many he could take out with mines and to see if he could lead some away. They're coming right for us damn it!"<br>
    </p>
    <p>Anna was speechless. A horde came by every week or so, but never in such quick succession as this. With their defences weakened and their ammunition stockpiles scarcely full from the last siege, they would surely be over run. Anna's mind was flooded with a series of daunting thoughts before grabbing a hold of herself and taking control. <br>
    "We better get as much of the wall prepared as we can. We'll need another trip to the mines if we're going to make any bullets. How much time do we have?" Anna begged Atlas.<br>
    "Not enough.." Atlas sighed. "They're going to be here in two hours, maybe less. A trip to the mine for a couple more bullets won't make enough of a difference. If we can cut some of these trees down to repare the moat and fire some more spikes into the courtyard we might buy ourselves some more time before they make it inside."<br>
    Anna nodded and hastily sped outside the compound to start felling trees. Between herself and Atlas, they got the moat in a more secure shape before Boldrick steered into the yard in Anna's old Jeep.
    </p>
    <p>Boldrick leaped out of the jeep wearing some pink jumpsuit and before the vehicle was even parked was already closing the drawbridge behind him.<br>
    "The horde is right behind me. Let's get inside and barricade the doors" he spat out, frantically.<br>
    The trio slammed the metal front door shut and began nailing wood to the front wall. The horde was on them like lightning. Anna could hear the low shuffling noises of the dead getting louder. Their ceaseless moans became a steady and maddening cry in her mind as she felt the enemy approaching their fortress. As Atlas began to climb the ladder to the next floor's workshop, Anna turned to Boldrick.<br>
    "Get up there Anna", Boldrick stated, "I'm gonna get these generators going and follow you up".<br>
    "Don't be a hero, come on!" Anna shouted over the groaning noises which were coming from the zombies just now breaching the yard.<br>
    Boldrick did one last sprint around the room, flicking each switch as he went. Like a blur, each bladed turret began to spin at an alarming rate. "I took the liberty of overloading the circuits. They'll burn out quickly but I don't think we're using them again" Boldrick yelled. His voice now was absolutely overpowered by the screeches of the dead as the pounded on the walls.<br></p>
    <p>Boldrick ushered Anna up the ladder and followed her quickly up. He slammed the trap door shut behind them and looked at the other two staring helplessly at him for answers. He could sense this wasn't going to end well. In the end, the dead always win. What they needed now was something ridiculous like one of those time warp bubbles he had seen in the super hero movies he had loved so much before the epidemic. The same ones his friends got bored listening to.<br>
    "The living area is the safest and most secure place" Atlas suggested, seeing if anyone was listening, and the other two nodded.<br>
    Boldrick, Anna and Atlas made their way into the living quarters. As Anna shut the door to her small one room apartment, the building seemed to shudder.<br>
    "They must be tearing down the exterior walls", Boldrick said, with horror sweeping his face.<br>
    Anna set her rifle down and equipped her beloved blunderbuss. If she was to go out, it would be with this unwieldy thing. Life in this probably German town was better than her old life in Ukraine. Though as she considered this thought, she decided she'd perhaps rather be back home than dealing with undead hordes every week.</p>
    <p>
    Boldrick pushed open one of the windows and started firing wildly with his machine gun. "If I'm going out, I'm taking as many of them out with me!" he shouted in quite a hopeless tone.<br>
    Atlas looked at Anna and shrugged. He unholstered his pistols and moved to the window to start blasting. As the building began to shift with what must have been the weight of hundreds of bodies slamming against it, one of the downstairs walls seemed to give way. The sounds of bricks falling upon one another and concrete cracking echoed and was soon drowned out by the blood curdling bellows of the downstairs defences as they churned the horde into pieces as it poured through the wall. Anna peaked outside the door. The floor of the workshop had collapsed with the breach. Undead were slowly clambering up the debris and towards the door. They could smell the fear. Anna swore and blasted the nearest creature with her blunderbuss before slamming the door shut again and shoving the wardrobe in front of it.</p>
    <p>
    "They're coming boys!" Anna called out. <br>
    She swung around and observed as Boldrick reloaded his belt fed gun and began opening fire once more, screaming maniacally as he did so. She could have sworn that she also saw Atlas drop a tear or two as he shot silently and impassively at the endless horde. They were all around them now. The building shifted again as another wall crumbled beneath their feet. This was to Anna's left, under the outside dining area she expected. The chairs she spent hours painting before all this were now likely whisked up by the blades. An almost soundless thud came from behind the wardrobe. She turned back round to face it as it got unbearably louder. She reloaded her blunderbuss and grappled with her emotions. She must be strong now. Anna's Place was just a place.. It was just a building.. Wasn't it?
    </p>
    <p>A fury over came her. These monsters were tearing apart everything she had worked to create. Anna's Place was everthing. It would never be replicated again. With a blind rage, she unleashed a volley of her blunderbuss shot into wardrobe. The projectile was so powerful it blew a hole in the front of the wardrobe and through the other side. Rapidly, she reloaded and began cycle firing into the fray which bit by bit was unfurling before her. She must have taken out dozens of the bastards before she reached into her bandolier to find no more shot left. She stowed the blunderbuss on her back and lurched forward with her spiked knuckle dusters. With dangerous grace she impaled one of the undead and dragged him through the half shattered door. If she could stall them even for a second more, she might be able to take out some more.</p>
    <p>Ah, but it was too late. As she turned to speak to her comrades, Boldrick beat her to it.<br>
    "They're coming up through the beer garden" Boldrick roared.<br>
    So they were. The door beside Boldrick almost burst at the seems as the undead had done the very same there as they did to Anna's door. There was no barricade available, and as the first zombie stumbled wantonly through the doorway, Boldrick stumbled backwards onto the bed. The zombie was just about on him until a blast from across the room sent it stumbling backwards. A second blast shattered it's dome quickly after.<br>
    "Behind the counter, quick!" Atlas beckoned to the others.<br>
    He tossed Anna her rifle and ducked for cover in the kitchenette. Boldrick twirled and flung his weapon at the undead coming in, buying him enough time to dash over and join Atlas behind the counter.</p>
    <p>Anna flimsily shot into the oncoming mess of wretch and horror and threw herself behind the counter with the others. The three looked at each other for a moment. Perhaps they were expecting some last words. Perhaps they hoped Boldrick had a last ditch idea. There was none. There was nothing left to say. Each knew the honour it had been surviving alongside the other. </p>
    <p>Boldrick pulled out a small blade from his jumpsuit and stabbed recklessly over the counter. As Anna and Atlas blasted at the mass which would soon engulf them, Boldrick was the first to fall. He pulled the knife out of one zombie and shoved it into another. He stabbed the undead straight in the chest and as he pulled the blade out, it seemed to catch on its ribs. Without a moment to think, another one had vaulted the counter and had landed on him - dispatching him instantly.</p>
    <p>Atlas was next as his final revolver shot rang out. His angry curses as he reached to grab another cartridge were replaced with a spine-shattering cry and was pulled into the horde.</p>
    <p>Anna beat back the horde with the bloody end of her rifle butt. She looked down at the quickly disappearing bodies of her friends and loved ones and stopped. The moment seemed to last forever. Her life flashed before her eyes. Her early life as a young maiden in Ukraine. Her addiction to tanning machines which left her with glistening yellow skin even now. Her dark signature pony-tailed hair and her gothic wear. She dreamt of big things. Owning her café someday which this canteen in the hardware store was a big step towards. Joining her sister in this place which was probably a German town given the road signs to work part-time at the beauty salon to find her feet. She recalled the day she met Atlas and Boldrick, where she quickly adopted the name Gramps for Atlas because he looked like an old man. She was not very inventive. How they quickly took over the hardware store and made it a fortress which had served them well until now. Those early days seemed so far away. Now the end was here. She closed her eyes, and as she felt her body be disassembled, her thoughts ceased.</p>

    <p>Anna's Place crumbled beneath the mass of undead which swarmed it. As the site was levelled, no sign of Anna, Boldrick or Atlas could be found. But Anna still felt something. Some deep necessity to push forward somewhere in her being. Perhaps she was a soul ascending to the afterlife. Perhaps a little bit of unpassed gas needed to be sent off. Perhaps she left the oven on. Perhaps Atlas had forgotten to take his lunch with him. With every bit of strength she had left, she fluttered open her eyes, expecting to see the undead horde tearing her apart. Instead, she saw a pristine version of Anna's Place. She stood and stumbled forward. Was this the afterlife? Was she doomed to relive this damned place forever? She heard voices outside; Could it be her friends? She shuffled to the door to the beer garden. Flinging it open, she could not believe her eyes as before her, she saw Boldrick and Atlas arguing over a card game at one of the tables. In the fields around the store, she expected to see the horde, but instead saw various lights. Some shimmering, some dimly lit, some brighter than any others. Crimsons, yellows and purples. Soon, all colours. Portals of some kind she sensed. She reached up a hand to shield her eyes from the sun and looked towards her friends.</p>

    <p>"Anna", Boldrick said warmly, unfurling his arms and gesturing towards an empty seat. "You're finally here."</p>

    <p>"Welcome, to the Anna-Verse."</p>
