        Anna-verse: A Time To Lose<br>

     <p>The docklands were somber. 18 ships lost in the past two months. Staggering losses like this drained moral and crippled leadership. Anna and her second in command, Captain Daved, watched as the stragglers from the last wreckage were brought to shore on the Resolute. A fine frigate with a solid crew, carrying wounded and weary souls from their watery grave to a place no better. The dock they just arrived in belonged to Bellmare. A tattered town belonging to a larger collapsing kingdom. Anna and Daved watched, growing ever more drained. Every man and woman brought back was not the one they were hoping for. </p>
     <p>Daved let his gaze fall to the floor. In his heart he knew their friend was not coming back. Anna kept watching, hoping Atlas would be among the survivors. Daved removed his Ironcap helmet. His machete like sword lay dulled in its sheathe. His hair was greasy and his chiseled, tanned face sweat lightly in the warm evening sun. Anna was slightly taller than him, with a ponytail of light grey hair and a worn, light leather duster over her under armor. Her musket was slung over her back. She cried gentle tears which glisted in the sun. A bittersweet scene.</p>
     <p>"I'll be at the tent if you need any assistance, Ma'am", Captain Daved said quietly. He lingered for a moment to see if his commander would respond, but after several moments he found only silence.</p>
     <p>Anna stood alone now. She pulled loose her silver hair and ran her hand through it. Two hobbling survivors passed by and glanced at her direction. "I'm sorry for your loss", one said, looking sympathetically to her. Anna nodded and kept her eyes trained on the dockyards. Atlas wasn't coming. Someone had to break the news to his men. Someone was her.</p>
     <p>Anna meandered back to town aimlessly. She turned words over in her mind about how to tell his men. His second in command would be field promoted. Or perhaps Captain Daved would be reassigned. Or perhaps she would be reassigned herself. Leave was almost up and they'd all return to the front shortly. It made her look inwards to herself. "War is hell", she thought, and she kicked the ground angrily.</p>
