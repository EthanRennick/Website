     <p>The docklands were somber. 18 ships lost in the past two months. Staggering losses like this drained moral and crippled leadership. Anna and her second in command, Captain Daved, watched as the stragglers from the last wreckage were brought to shore on the Resolute. A fine frigate with a solid crew, carrying wounded and weary souls from their watery grave to a place no better. The dock they just arrived in belonged to Bellmare. A tattered town belonging to a larger collapsing kingdom. Anna and Daved watched, growing ever more drained. Every man and woman brought back was not the one they were hoping for. </p>
     <p>Daved let his gaze fall to the floor. In his heart he knew their friend was not coming back. Anna kept watching, hoping Atlas would be among the survivors. Daved removed his Ironcap helmet. His machete like sword lay dulled in its sheathe. His hair was greasy and his chiseled, tanned face sweat lightly in the warm evening sun. Anna was slightly taller than him, with a ponytail of light grey hair and a worn, light leather duster over her under armor. Her musket was slung over her back. She cried gentle tears which glisted in the sun. A bittersweet scene.</p>
