        <p>"Captain Daved," Anna called out, "Report." Anna scanned the horizon to catch a glimpse of her second in command. She held her musket tightly, her other hand firmly grasping her horse's reins. She spotted him pulling the sword out of an enemy serf and turning to sprint to her location.</p>
        <p>Daved ran to his commander. "The battle progresses well, My Lady. We've routed two enemy units, however the men are tired. It would serve us well to head back and recooperate while you push on with some of the others." Daved was clearly out of breath, and splashes of blood coated his armor. His woolly shoulder pads and toughened leather tunic were worn, and his shortsword was in need of cleaning. His iron helmet had a dent on its rim. Anna already knew it could have well been his own blood coating him, his comrades or from a foe.</p>
        <p>"Proceed with the tactical withdrawal, I shall take the halberdiers and press forward the left flank", Anna stated confidently. "You have served me well once again, Captain" she smiled at him, graciously. Her right hand man had served beside her in the field of battle since war broke out on the continent. His battalion of swordsmen had proved effective in many battles, and she was admittedly fond of him.</p>
        <p>Daved nodded and beckoned to his men. Some of them had fallen in combat, and several appeared quite injured, but their struggle was not over and they would not surrender easily. They finished defeating the enemy group of serfs and pulled away from the front lines, following Daved to the rear camp.</p>
        <p>The halberds grouped up in a phalanx formation beside Anna. The battalion captain looked at her, his face was ripe with sweat and he looked eager for battle, steadfast and with a firm grip on his polearm. "Captain, you will hold the left flank until you deem it possible to advance. I need you all in top form, do not falter and do not fail me." Anna's voice was stern, but there was a comfort to her words. The men beneath her knew that she had their back. They marched off into the heat of battle.</p>
        <p>The battle progressed into the night. It was not until the end of the siege when Anna was again reunited with the rest of the men under her command. She recounted the battle from start to finish; From the time the swordsmen under Daved charged into battle until their retreat after weakening the frontline. She recalled how her halberdiers and another unit of shieldmen, under the command of her close friend and ally, Atlas, held the left flank for hours. They faced death in the eye with each volley of arrows unleashed unto them, and they held until Anna's unit of Grenadiers could relieve the tension and their advance could begin. Her grenadiers wore plain, quite ornate huntsmen outfits and feathered tall hats and on their belts they carried clay pots filled with brimstone and hellfire.</p>
        <p>The volleys of the grenadiers lit the evening haze up with fantastic flames, as enemy units routed in the explosions amidst their ranks. By then, the right flank had fallen and this one was no different. The halberds advanced, and commenced the slaughter.</p>
        <p>Anna fought throughout the day, allowing her men to rest, but never herself. She exhausted her supply of caltrops, fire bombs and fine gunpowder. Even when her horse had fallen in the fray, she was aided by Commander James and recooperated nearer to the right flank and was instrumental in its collapse.</p>
        <p>The imagery of the battle kept her up that night while she tried to sleep. Explosions flashed in her mind. In some ways, she still sensed as if she could feel the splashes of blood against her skin. War haunts all those involved. It favours no man or woman, and spares none of its horror. She emerged from her tent and began to search for her men. She found Daved and a group of his swordsmen mingling with some of the other allied troops. They appeared to be Atlas' or James' men. She smiled slightly, content to see them take some comfort in their shared experience and positions.</p>
        <p>"How did you do, Captain?", she called from afar. Daved turned around on his bench, and upon seeing her, ran to her side. "Personally Commander?" he asked, with a grin on his face. "I always count mine alone, fair is fair this time" Anna responded, humoring his mood.</p>
        <p>"15, ma'am", Daved said, eyeing his commander and waiting giddily. "If I had a hundred men like you, I'd be unstoppable, Daved" Anna said, warmly. "I know I do the work of a hundred men, ma'am, but you must remember I am still but one man", he replied.</p>
        <p>"32, my dear captain", Anna said, and she put her hands on her hips. "A group effort of course wins the day, ma'am" Daved said. He glanced back at the men behind him. "Permission to return to the gathering ma'am?" he asked. He could see the unsettled eyes of his commander, and he didn't like it. He knew the effects of these sieges and campaigns. Even when he felt he was brazen to it, it caught him unaware in a dream or some noise or speech and the experiences would come flooding back to terrify him. He did not want to be near his commander when that happened. 'Professional reasons' he told himself, so as not to belittle his faith in her as his leader, but there was a part of him that felt helpless in the situation and did not want to let that slip either.</p>
        <p>"Be with them, your light spirits raise mine" Anna said, and she meant it. Daved scampered back, somewhat with a stagger as an ale or two sat in his stomach.</p>
        <p>Anna continued her patrol of the camp. Soon she would be reassigned. In the North, another army should have been pushing towards the enemy capital and the war could be over soon. As she was aware, Atlas and James may be marching there too while she held another post. Whatever the future held, she knew she would not forget these sieges. These drawn out battles, these bloody and sleepless nights, and these times of solice in the bittersweet scenes where she could find her men making the most of it.</p>
        <p>Whatever the future held, she only hoped that she and her men could stay together. Through thick and thin was always their agreement. And she would long for nothing more than to march to the ends of the world with them by her side. She would receive new orders by dawn, and she nervously awaited what they may be.</p>
        <p>She returned quietly to her tent and the moon shone high above. The stars twinkled, and the sound of the rabble in the camp slowly died down. Even in the quiet of her quarters, the silence was deafening. Inescapable nightmares would ensue if she slept, so she didn't. She rarely did. When dawn came beaming up over the battlefield the next day and revealed just how much blood was spilled, she knew she would not sleep again any time soon.</p>
