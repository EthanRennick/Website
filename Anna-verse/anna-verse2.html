        <p>"Captain Daved," Anna called out, "Report." Anna scanned the horizon to catch a glimpse of her second in command. She held her musket tightly, her other hand firmly grasping her horse's reins. She spotted him pulling the sword out of an enemy serf and turning to sprint to her location.</p>
        <p>Daved ran to his commander. "The battle progresses well, My Lady. We've routed two enemy units, however the men are tired. It would serve us well to head back and recooperate while you push on with some of the others." Daved was clearly out of breath, and splashes of blood coated his armor. His woolly shoulder pads and toughened leather tunic were worn, and his shortsword was in need of cleaning. His iron helmet had a dent on its rim. Anna already knew it could have well been his own, his comrades or from a foe.</p>
