            <h5>Ode To Tom</h5>

            I want someone<br>
            To fall in love with Tom<br>
            The way I fell in love<br>
            With Tom<br><br>

            Tom has a soul<br>
            That radiates happiness<br>
            Tom has a mind<br>
            That exuberates cleverness<br>
            Tom has eyes<br>
            That reassure and analyse<br>
            Tom has hands<br>
            That raise others to new highs<br><br>

            I want someone<br>
            To fall in love with Tom<br>
            The way I fell in love<br>
            With Tom<br><br>

            Tom is tall<br>
            Tom is strong<br>
            Tom could brawl<br>
            With Charles De Gaulle<br><br>

            Tom is brave<br>
            Tom is smart<br>
            Tom is a gentleman<br>
            With a passionate heart<br><br>

            Tom is eternal<br>
            Tom is internal<br>
            Tom is always with me<br>
            I hope someone else sees<br><br>

            I want someone<br>
            To fall in love with Tom<br>
            The way I fell in love<br>
            With Tom<br>

            <h5>A poem I just made up about the prompt 'unravelling', done in the shitty rupi kaur style</h5>
            
               You pulled on<br>
               a loose thread<br>
               on the tapestry<br>
               of my life.<br>
                <br>
                Now my world<br>
                has become<br>
                <br>
                undone.<br>

            

            <h5>Postman's Lement</h5>
            I tried to deliver<br>
            Your package<br>
            But you were not<br>
            At home<br>
            <br>
            <h5>Kokomo</h5>
            With galaxies in her eyes<br>
            And magic, gentle sighs<br>
            She captivates my heart<br>
            like a work of art.<br>
            <br>
            Though she is far away<br>
            Together we often say<br>
            "I love you my dear, forever,<br>
            You're my little piece of treasure."<br>
            <br>
            <h5>To One Lost</h5>
            My aching bones all marrowed with regret<br>
            Hold up an ancient veil, distant eyes wet.<br>
            Single sorrow frown, lying in black ground<br>
            In a lonely land, nightingales surround.<br>
            <br>
            And bless us with a melody, so sweet and clear, the sound!<br>
            Please fret not thee, lamenting bird, for I am all around.<br>
            <br>
            <h5>Whispers</h5>
            The mighty oak holds up a leafy crown<br>
            By river's edge, an ancient shadow walks<br>
            And listens to whispering reeds in time,<br>
            A hushed symphony of times long gone by.<br>
            <br>
            A rotten dam of fate blocks the path<br>
            And collapses under its own dark weight.<br>
            Then it scatters memories all around<br>
            Picked up by the grass, and told to the ground.<br>
            <br>
            The ground told the sea, the sea told the air<br>
            The lone shadow begged, how could that be fair?<br>
            Then shadow sat down, shrouded by the weeds<br>
            And told us old lies, so he could be free<br>
            <br>
            Why do we speak of others so blindly?<br>
            If you somehow know, I beg you, come find me.<br>
            <br>
            <h5>Depth</h5>
            The Depth of Water<br>
            is all relative to the depth of that<br>
            which the water is contained in.<br>
            <br>
            The depth of my love<br>
            extends deeper than any other thing.<br>
            It does not compare<br>
            <br>
            to the measurement of the happiness<br>
            and love deep within my heart<br>
            when I hold your hand in mine.<br>
            <br>
            When you lay your head on my shoulder,<br>
            and we fall asleep beneath the undending display<br>
            of light and wonder above.<br>
            <br>
            I will forever be<br>
            entranced by your smile<br>
            and the inch of sadness<br>
            <br>
            That I feel when we part each night.<br>
            The depth of my love is incomparible<br>
            to the universe.<br>
            <br>
            <h5>Nanny</h5>
            The world has changed since you left<br>
            Or perhaps I've just grown up, and<br>
            see the cracks in the ice of society.<br>
            The poverty, the killings, inequality and theft.<br>
            And people try so hard to deal with it in<br>
            their own ways - hard work, suicide, insobriety.<br>
            <br>
            I still hold to my heart the thought that if you were still here<br>
            The world but not be such a dark place,<br>
            that maybe you could have shielded us grandkids.<br>
            However, I find myself now writing in this book,<br>
            my hand trembling with fear<br>
            And wishing that I could lie in bed for eternity<br>
            and to never again feel the pain of opening my eyelids.<br>
            <br>
            I miss you, more than I can articulate.<br>
            and I hope that you're happy and so content, wherever you are.<br>
            I'll ensure my kids know the hero you were<br>
            Your tale, I'll reiterate.<br>
            And tell them that if they need you, you're always here<br>
            Look up, find the most beautiful and brightest star.<br>
            <h5>If I Never Sleep</h5>
            If I never sleep<br>
            I'll never see your face.<br>
            It hurts me too much when I do.<br>
            And you only appear when I sleep anyway<br>
            Since the heavens took you away.<br>
