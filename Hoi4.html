            Hearts of Iron IV is a grand strategy wargame that focuses on World War II. <br>
            The player may take control of any nation in the world in either 1936 or 1939 and lead them to victory or defeat against other countries.<br>
            <br>
            I shall endeavour to describe the game in a few brief lines:
            <br>
            You're looking at a world map. You control one of the countries. Imagine risk, but smaller. Tensions are rising in the world and you're in the middle of it.<br>
            Whether you're Germany under the Fascists, France with a divided nation or one of the many other countries trying to survive like Cuba, Spain, Ethiopia or Ireland.<br>
            You will have to develop your industry to support your civilians and also turn your war machine. You will have to create an army capable of war, for defence or for territorial gains.<br>
            You will have to juggle political power, by making decisions, electing officials, raising instability and causing coups or destabilising other nations.<br>
            You have limited resources and will have to fight on land, air and sea to be effective. Your destiny is your own if you can muster the power to take it.<br>
            <br>
            All in all, it's a very interesting strategy game which requires management in so many areas. You will need cunning tactics, plans and the will of the people on your side. <br>
            Your government is yours to warp in your hands. Your neighbours can be friends, foes or subjects. Join in factions with other countries to create alliances.<br>
            I've spent 1,200 hours so far in this game. I love how diverse, in depth and how many mods there are. It's a beautiful game with a need for great critical thinking.<br>
            I highly recommend.<br>

            <h2>Ethan's Favourite Hoi4 Memory</h2>
            It was a multiplayer game early on in my time playing. I had picked Latvia, who was very weak historically at this time.<br>
            The USSR had the tiny republic in its sights. I DIDN'T KNOW THIS.<br>
            I set out igniting a fascist coup and conquering my nearby states and creating a Baltic Empire. I was so happy. <br>
            I had ambitions. Poland was weak. I had German allies. The world was my oyster. <br><br>
            Withing six months of me gloating to my friends, my country was on the brink of surrender. <br>
            The Soviet forces smashed through my huge frontline. I had two units left defending my capital, Riga.<br>
            As they ran out of food and ammunition, I ordered them to retreat to allied Germany. Latvia fell instantly.<br>

            <br>
            My two units spent the remainder of the war on MP duty in newly annexed France, circa Alsace-Lorraine.<br>
            We never reconquered the Baltics.<br>
            It was a sad, sad night.<br><br>

            Every game is an unforgettable one, where you can imagine your actions having real life historical consequences.<br>
