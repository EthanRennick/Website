        Welcome to my little update blogs. <a href="Blog.html">Return: Blogs</a><br>

<body id = "welcome" > 
    These are going to be little updates, stories, reviews or any little old bit of thought that may be of interest. <br>
    These may be Frayed World related, or code related or anything else that I want to share.<br>
    I just want to separate some things out to give the illusion of organisation! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br>
