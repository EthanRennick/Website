<h3>Dive Deeper:</h3>

<body>
    It seems you've chosen to dive deeper. Well, what can I say? <br>
    <h5>Personal Life:</h5>
    My favourite colour is green - a nice emerald green. And Burgundy; That nice wine colour? Oh yeah. <br>
    My favourite soup brand is Potato & Leek. My favourite suit brand is French Connection.<br>
    I have a son, Barry, who was born during October of 2019. He is still small, but he's learning about the world so
    fast.<br>
    He loves to play, sleep, eat and watch the children's channel on Disney, where he is mezmerised by the shapes.<br>
    His cognitive skills are quite advanced for his age. I raised him myself, as his mother abandoned him when he was
    born.<br>
    He is also a cat. <br>
    <h5>Education and Achievements:</h5>
    So far, I have achieved a leaving cert. I scored 422 points.<br>
    I've earned medals for art, sports and two prominent certificates from the Pope for being an outstanding member of
    the community.<br>
    I'm in my third year of Games Development in IT Carlow. My grades are fair, and I expect to pass I'm now on work placement with CBE.<br>
    I've developed titles such as "Elsaman", "Moose and Buffalo", "Zombie Skyscraper" and a Star Wars TM game based on
    Asteroids.<br>
