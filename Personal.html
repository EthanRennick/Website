    <h3>Dive Deeper:</h3>
        <body>
        It seems you've chosen to dive deeper. Well, what can I say? <br>
        <h5>Personal Life:</h5>
            My favourite colour is green - a nice emerald green. And Burgundy; That nice wine colour? Oh yeah. <br>
            My favourite soup brand is Potato & Leek. My favourite suit brand is French Connection.<br>
            I like Ronald Reagan, because I don't know much about politics, and I really love his acting.<br>
            I have a son, Barry, who was born during October of 2019. He is still small, but he's learning about the world so fast.<br>
            He loves to play, sleep, eat and watch the children's channel on Disney, where he is amazed by the shapes.<br>
            His cognitive skills are quite advanced for his age. I raised him myself, as his mother abandoned him when he was born.<br>
        <h5>Education and Achievements:</h5>
            So far, I have achieved a leaving cert. I scored 422 points.<br>
            I've earned medals for art, sports and two prominent certificates from the Pope for being an outstanding member of the community.<br>
            I'm in my third year of Games Development in IT Carlow. My grades are not great, but I'm passing.<br>
            I've developed titles such as "Elsaman", "Moose and Buffalo", "Shitris" and a Star Wars TM game based on Asteroids.<br>
