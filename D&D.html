       Dungeons and Dragons is a fantasy tabletop roleplaying game. It allows the player to create their own character with their own story.<br>
       They journey and quest in a world created by another player - The Dungeon Master, who controls NPC's and the enemies.<br><br>
       The Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game is about storytelling in worlds of sword and sorcery. It shares elements with childhood games of make-believe.<br>
        Like those games, D&D is driven by imagination. It’s about picturing the towering castle beneath the stormy night sky and imagining how a fantasy <br>
        adventurer might react to the challenges that scene presents.<br><br>

        Unlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the adventurers’ action. <br>
        Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their adventurers can scale a cliff, roll away from the <br>
        strike of a magical lightning bolt, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.<br><br>

        In the Dungeons & Dragons game, each player creates an adventurer (also called a character) and teams up with other adventurers (played by friends). <br>
        Working together, the group might explore a dark dungeon, a ruined city, a haunted castle, a lost temple deep in a jungle, or a lava-filled cavern <br>
        beneath a mysterious mountain. The adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle fantastic monsters, and discover fabulous magic<br>
        items and other treasure.<br>

    <h2>Ethan's Favourite D&D Memory</h2>
    Most of my d&d experience is as a DM, so while I don't have many experiences as a player, I have many as enemies and NPCs.<br>
    As I described on my interests page, I love stories and writing. I created many characters that my player's have loved and made art of in their own time.<br>
    I've created worlds, npcs and enemies which my players have fought and befriended. Their favourite was an elf called Taycko.<br>
    Taycko was cursed and suffered from insanity. He was unpredictable. The favourite moment from the campaign overall was when, during a tense moment, Taycko cast a spell.<br>
    A rope fell from the ceiling which led to a pocket dimension. The players climbed the rope and lived in the pocket dimension until they returned to the dungeon.<br><br>

    
    Great fun for literally anyone.<br>
