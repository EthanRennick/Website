    <p>"Launch all remaining fighters, Rc", Vale said quietly. The battle raged on outside as the Empire tore through the rebel fleet. Admiral Asteen barked orders on the bridge. Troops hurried to and fro to combat fires and man stations. The squadrons already launched were being dessimated. Doom was quite certain</p>
    <p>"Roger Roger", Rc replied. He processed the command for a moment and then ran to a nearby comm unit. "All pilots to the hangar bay. All pilots to the hangar bay. All fighters for launch."</p>
    <p>He locked the console and then ran back to Vale. "Sir, permission to engage the enemy?" he asked. Vale smiled. His loyal companion was programmed for battle after all. "I'll meet you in the hangar bay. Prepare the Star Bomber for take off."</p>
    <p>"Roger Roger", he replied, sprinting off clunkily to the turbo lift. Vale's commlink started beeping rapidly. The admiral's voice started bellowing from it. "That order came from your location. We need to jump to hyperdrive. Belay your orders and recall the squadrons." Vale tapped the commlink. "Negative Admiral. You need to get the officers and codes to the Alliance. The fighters have hyperdrive, we'll try make our way to my old station. That is all"</p>
    <p>"Dammit", Asteen shouted to his crew, "That Jedi thinks he's still in command." He thought for a brief moment then slammed his fist onto his console. "Prep the hyperdrive", he ordered, and his officers ran to carry it out. </p>
    <p>Vale made it to the hangar bay. He saw Rc engaging the engines of their modified Y-Wing, the Star Bomber. It's sleek red paint and added turrets were highlighted every moment by the flashing lights. The battle outside could barely be heard between the blaring sirens. Rc jumped out of the cock-pit. "Good luck, sir" Rc stated and ran off to man another fighter, an older X-Wing. Vale saw in the distance his other droid companion, Gc, prepping for evacuation with his Pantoran friend Tika. Her pink hair and blue skinned were splattered with oil from an engine she had just repaired. She looked in his direction and saluted. Vale nodded slightly and entered his ship. They would be staying behind on this one.</p>
    <p>Vale engaged the engines and sealed his cockpit. He hardly took the necessary time to ensure all systems were operational before rapidly taking off and flying out of the bay. What he say outside haunted him. A grim reminder of the old battles he endured for the republic. Though this time, his enemy was the bleak Empire that rose from the Republic's ashes. The ship's astromech droid whirred into action, taking control of the port and starboard turrets, engaging lighter craft like Tie Fighters while Vale skilfully engaged an enemy cruiser with the larger cannons and forward lasers. He flew over a command ship's bridge section and released a volley of bombs from the Star Bombers torpedo section. Explosions racketed into the cruiser's hull and blew shrapnel and large hull sections into space.</p>
    <p>He could see the Rebel Fleet about to enter hyperdrive. "Remnants of all remaining squadrons," he announced over his comm system, "Form up on me." Soon, fighters from the fleet belonging to different squadrons began to join his formation. Different emblems and different paint jobs contrasted greatly as the fleet's survivors formed into Vale's "Remnant Squadron". Several ships joined, including Rc in his older X-wing. "Lets cover the fleet's escape and make sure the rebellion lives to fight another day!", Vale announced over the comms.</p>
    <p>Pilots reported in. "Bo-4, standing by." "Green-3, standing by." "Viligence squadron, three fighters remaining." Many more joined the ranks after. Vale had his fighters.</p>
    <p>The fleet bore down on the cruiser the jedi had ruthlessly bombarded before. In formation, the group of Y-wings, X-wings, A-wings and one B-wing all tore into the hull of the cruiser. Whooping and cheering could be heard over the comms channel as the pilots celebrated the ship's damage. They reared away into a retreat formation as the cruiser began to drift and its engines exploded. It smashed into several Tie fighters and escape pods began firing from its side. Another Imperial cruiser replaced it almost immediately, replacing its position in the Imperial attack.</P>
    <p>The battle continued. Each side relentless in their attack. The morality of the rebel pilots slipping slowly into despair as their fleet fell apart - until - The rebel cruisers all shot into hyperspace, leaving a void where there was once laser fire. Drifting pieces of debris was the only aftermath left behind. Vale gave the order to retreat. "Punch these coordinates into your nav systems, folks", he said, punching his nav system's keypad, "I hope we all make it.."</p>
    <p>Ship after ship disappeared from the battle. Vale watched as two of his squad were shot down by a Tie fighter as they punched in the coords. He waited. He watched until every fighter left. He engaged several more enemy Tie fighters and looked around desperately for his friend, Rc. He was torn between fearing the worst and hoping he had already made it out.</p>
    <p>Then he saw it. With flaming engines and battered wings, but prepping hyperdrive and - He made it out. He breathed a sigh of relief and disengaged from the battle. He pulled the hyperdrive lever and blasted into a blue, dazzling stream of light. The coords he gave to the remnant squadron were for his old space station. The place he had hid from the Empire before one lonely Pantoran convinced him to join the Rebellion. He hoped he would see her again. He hoped he would see Gc, the Admiral and Rc again. He hoped the other fighters had the fuel and systems operations to meet him there. His astromech beeped quietly, questioning the same. Vale sighed. He'd do anything for the rebellion. He hoped he could do more. All he could do now was wait.</p>
    <p>And wait, and wait, and wait.</p>
