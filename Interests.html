            <li>For my 18th birthday, my dad and I bought a 1957 Standard 8. It was in poor condition.<br>
                Over the past few months, we've been fixing it up. Here it is on day 1.<br></li>
            <li>We transported it on a trailer to my Grandad's garage, where we set to work stripping its interior.<br>
                The outside was very rusted. There were holes in the body. The carpet was moldy. The chairs were in good nick though!<br>
                We started sanding it down then.</li>
            <li>Some parts were painted and being fitted while some still looked terrible. So much welding had to be done.<br>
                In the third photo, the front fenders and bumper is primered, but the bonnet is still in poor condition!</li>
            <li>With our pieces welded and fixed, I personally had paint chosen and mixed. It had a glossy sheen.<br>
                I also chose to paint it in two tone, contrasting the single peach colour it came in.</li>
            <li>With some of its pieces put back on, this is the current state. There's still interior work to be done.<br>
                The engine is running, there's just no exhaust or fuel line! But we're working on it.<br>
                Parts are so so hard to come by, and some it is jury-rigged, but we love our car a lot.</li>

    <h2>Writing</h2>
        <body>
            I've always loved writing since I was young. Now that I'm at home, I have so much time to develop
            worlds and create characters and come up with creative arcs. <br>
            Here's a link to another site I have. <a href="https://ethanrennickwriting.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Ethan's Blog Site</a><br>
            I have short stories here which I am regularly adding to. I am working on making my own site to display these in the future.<br>
            I also intend to compile these into a book in the future and have it published. Don't let your dreams be dreams!!!

    <h2>History</h2>
        <body>
            I have a love for history. I have always loved the topic and I thoroughly enjoy learning about the past.<br>
            I've done the family history by using our National Archives. I did it over the course of a week.<br>
            I had to apply to use the documents, and they weren't always complete. It took a lot of investigation and thorough searching.<br>
            In the end, I had marriage certs, birth certs and some death certs for many family members extending back to the 1800s!<br>
            <br>
            I also collect a lot of old artefacts and antique things. I have several collections I'm very proud of.<br>
            I have a very large old stamp collection. These stamps come from literally all over the world, even from some places that no longer exist.<br>
            My most treasured one is Grace Kelly's marriage stamps. They were issued in 1950 to celeberate her marriage to Prince Rainier. <br>
            I own two typewriters. I own a large coin collection. I own a 20s French Rapier. I have several pieces of ww1 and ww2 military equipment.<br>
            I collect a lot of old books, rings, statues and other assorted oddities.These are all really important to me, and my collection is forever growing!<br>
