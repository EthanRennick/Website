        <h4>Dream</h4>
        My love is akin to a dream<br>
        Ethereal and divine<br>
        Quenching infernos  to melancholic repose<br>
        Passion to distance<br>
        Sweet embrace to longing<br>
        A boundless sea of emotion and warmth<br>
        Your ship sails upon it<br>
        Tossed by the winds<br>
        But never ceasing<br>
        Journeying unto my shores<br>
        To be with me once more<br>
        In my unchained dreams<br>
        Still you deem<br>
        My heart esteemed<br>
        Thy kiss supreme<br>
        I am redeemed<br>
        In fervent streams<br>
        Your eyes gleam <br>
        With devotion and loving splendour<br>

        <h4>Widow</h4>
        Unsuspecting, I entered your lair<br>
        You stalked me from afar and moved in for the kill<br><br>

        The web you weave encompasses me in a cocoon of silk<br>
        As your venom pulses through my veins.<br><br>

        I fall into a slumber cradled in your arms;<br>
        The corrupting embrace of death.<br><br>

        Submitting to your will, I am helpless to defend.<br>
        You paralyse me<br>
        I am yours<br>

        <h4>All Roads Lead To You</h4>
        Through twists and turns I stride<br>
        You are my journey<br>
        My Destination<br>
        I'm on my way to you<br><br>

        All roads lead to you<br>
        You never escape my mind<br>
        You are my everything<br>
        My Rome<br>
        I'm on my way to you<br>

        <h4>Brother</h4>
        For years I tried to hide from his rambling and his aggression,<br>
        I hid from the confusion and paranoia of his drug induced psychosis.<br><br>

        Now he's so far gone, he may as well be someone else.<br>
        I feel ashamed to turn away but it's all I can bear to do.<br><br>

        I still feel the need to dodge his visits, I'm not comfortable around him<br>
        But I don't want to lose him forever, I just want him to get better.<br>

        <h4>Teresa</h4>
        I remember my nan very fondly<br>
        A stalwart symbol of wisdom<br>
        Sitting in the chair by the fire<br>
        With a newspaper and tea beside her<br><br>
        
        She'd go out and break the sticks with an axe<br>
        And tell stories of fairies and elves<br>
        She'd have dinner each day for the kids coming in<br>
        And save the last plate for herself<br><br>
        
        Her skin was a well written map<br>
        That detailed her well lived life<br>
        Her eyes though fading still gazed out<br>
        As she longed to be roaming about<br><br>
         
        A century passed before being called<br>
        To take her place at Gods right hand side<br>
        But she's always with me, she hasn't left<br>
        She's my guardian and my guide<br>

        <h4>you are too beautiful</h4>
        you are too beautiful for these undeserving eyes<br>
        you, the radiant and unchained soul <br><br>

        you are too beautiful for my mere labourers hands;<br>
        adorned in the cuts and bruises of the seasons harvest<br><br>

        you are too beautiful for the sun catching tears on my cheeks<br>
        but not for the red worm that burrows through your heart<br><br>

        <h4>Drip</h4>
        I watched the morning dew dripping<br>
        From the weeping willow while sitting<br>
        By the waves as they lapped the stony shore<br>
        And rain cracked stones with mighty roars,<br>
        Falling with such velocity,<br>
        I was incomplete<br>
        I watched the morning dew dripping<br>
        Rearing itself up into a tempest<br>

        <h4>Toad One</h4>
        My lips on yours had no effect<br>
        There was nothing to unveil<br>
        I thought you were a victim<br>
        But you were the mastermind<br>
        Behind my pain<br>
        And my destruction<br>

        <h4>Toad Two</h4>
        I leaned in<br>
        I prayed<br>
        Would my kiss<br>
        Restore your faith?<br>

        <h4>Bounce One</h4>
        Mourning is hard<br>
        To bounce back from<br>
        When the comfort of nothingness<br>
        Is luxuriously desirable<br>

        <h4>Bounce Two</h4>> 
        My heart skips a beat when you touch my hand<br>
        Somersaults of anxiety when we cuddle quietly<br>
        A kiss so fiery on skin like ivory<br>
        You're the blood in my veins I need so vitally<br>
        Being with you is paradise firsthand<br>

        <h4>Lovers Fortune</h4>
        Fortunately for me<br>
        I met you<br>
        My life has become complete<br>
        Long before it reaches its end<br>

        <h4>Wandering Rose</h4>

        A rose sways in the hedge<br>
        The sky above is overcast and black<br>
        Its petals are beaten wide by rain<br>
        Although I walk onward<br>
        I thoughtlessly turn my head for a final look<br>
        And I see the rose fall to the ground<br>

        <h4>A Keen Interest</h4>

        You're a dangerous saint.<br>
        Powerful, but not tyrannical.<br>
        Intelligent, but not arrogant.<br>
        Kind, but not na√Øve.<br>
        Cunning, but reserved.<br>
        Your father taught you how to rule.<br>
        Your loyalty is not to me,<br>
        But to the land below.<br>

        <h4>Arms</h4>

        Lift me up<br>
        Pull me down<br>
        Do anything you like<br>
        Except go<br>

        <h4>Nan</h4>
        It was a cold December<br>
        When I bid you farewell<br>
        And I watched your soul be freed<br>
        To rise to the world above <br>
