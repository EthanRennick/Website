        I have organised my favourite games into a little table here, with my personal rating and a link for more information.
        <p>
            <table id="gametable">
                <tr><th>Game</th>     <th>My Rating</th>    <th>Link</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Hearts of Iron 4</td>      <td>7.8/10</td>           <td><a href="Hoi4.html" target="_blank">Hearts of Iron 4</a></td></tr>
                <tr><td>Rimworld</td>            <td>9/10</td>             <td><a href="Rimworld.html" target="_blank">Rimworld</a></td></tr>
                <tr><td>D&D</td>                 <td>10/10</td>            <td><a href="D&D.html" target="_blank">D&D</a></td></tr>

         I play a variety of games. I play mostly strategy, management, colony building, survival and rpg games. <br>
         Such games include those above, but also Skyrim, Cities:Skylines, Hearthstone and World of Warcraft.<br>
         I love taking control of people and leading them towards victory. I love getting attached to villagers, naming them, building them homes.<br>
         I enjoy making cities, working with insfrastructure and surviving when the odds are against me.<br>
