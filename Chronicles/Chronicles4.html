    <p>Stars fell over Irrilith. Worms saw each star. He gazed and he counted them, navigating his make-believe ship from the balcony of Silver Creek Palace.</p>
    <p>The large wooden structure with its blue tiles and white timbered walls was a site to behold for all in the city. It could be seen clearly from the harbour by anyone entering the city; A clear run from the waterline to the palace up the main street.</p>
    <p>Worms saw trade ships come and go each day and night from the balconies. He longed to be with them. He was wearing a thin white shirt and his hair had been freshly washed and brushed. Long ringlets bounced either side of his face, falling below the shoulder blades. Even his beard had been trimmed and shortened. Scars on his hands reminded him of different times in his life. Another scar on his chest was visible only to the birds flying by, highlighted by the pale moonlight.</p>
    <p>The breeze was gentle. The summer months in Irrilith were gorgeous. He should have been happier but Worms hadn't been happy in a long time. His thoughts lay elsewhere. He struggled to focus on Silver Creek, on Amelia and his newborn children. He had fought two rebellions since entering the family. He was ridden with guilt over the arms-shipments he had made in the past. A job he took that armed the rebels who had killed Amelia's father and brother. Amelia knew this secret, and comforted him about it each night it came up in conversation. Alas, Worms couldn't fight it. The past was a very persistent voice inside of him.</p>
    <p>He leaned over the balcony and drew lines with his finger over the ancient wood. His finger traced over grooves, knots and splinters as his thoughts meandered idly. He wondered where his ship was. He thought about his crew and his friends; Virgil, who was like a brother to him rules in his stead. He hoped to return one day. He had always been more comfortable there than in Silver Creek. Even as a consort to Amelia Saint Eden, he had duties far outside his comfort zone. Amelia knew this too well. Her voice behind him alerted him to her presence.</p>
    <p>"I knew I'd find you here", Amelia spoke quietly with a smile.</p>
    <p>Worms turned and looked through the patio door. She was wearing a long white gown. In the candlelight her golden hair shined. She stepped toward him slowly as worms leaned with his back toward the balcony. She approached and gently wrapped her arms around him, hugging his chest.</p>
    <p>A million thoughts raced through his head as he placed his arms around her, pulling her close.</p>
    <p>"You know me" he sighed.</p>
    <p>Amelia frowned, though Worms couldn't see. She knew he was thinking of leaving. She knew it plagued his mind like a disease. She also understood how uncomfortable he was here. Not because he wasn't cared for or that he was neglected; but that he didn't really love being cared for, waited on or served. Silver Creek made him feel out of place. The urchin that used to fight for scraps in the rotting city of Wolves Port would never be content here.</p>
    <p>Amelia took Worms' hand and led him into their bedroom. The bed was beautifully made; Fit for a Lord and Lady. She sat on the end and patted beside her, beckoning him to join her.</p>
    <p> He took his place, unwilling to look at her.</p>
    <p>"I know", she spoke softly. Her voice was like the most enchanting melody to Worms. He could listen to her speak for hours.</p>
    <p>"And you know I can't", he replied, holding her hand in his and looking across the room.</p>
    <p>There was a pause as both of them sat in thought.</p>
    <p>"You belong out there", Amelia said. Worms knew that already, but Amelia was still convincing herself.</p>
    <p>"I can't just leave you here", Worms began but was cut off.</p>
    <p>"You're not leaving me!" Amelia started. "You've got a different life to live, Worms. A life away from Irrilith." </p>
    <p>Her voice cracked in the silent room. The only sound that he could hear was the falling of her tears.</p>
    <p>"Leaving you is something I promised never to do. I have to stick by you" he replied.</p>
    <p>Amelia tightened her grip on his hand and looked at the side of his face. She studied the lines. A faint scar on his cheek. A few grey hairs in his beard.</p>
    <p>"It's not leaving me if I give you my blessing", she pleaded.</p>
    <p>Worms took a deep breath and looked agitatedly around the room. He hated how this made him feel. </p>
    <p>"The children will be fine. They're already walking. There are plenty of nurses and servants and teachers to care for them. Merilyn will help too. You have to do this" she explained.</p>
    <p>Worms just couldn't buy it. Were his own needs more important than his role here, than his kids, than his marriage to Amelia? He felt selfish and rotten.</p>
    <p>As the two sat in the room, Amelia took her hand and placed it on his cheek. She turned his face towards her. Worms' eyes welled as he looked at her.</p>
    <p>"Your eyes, Amy", he choked, "I'll never find in anyone else's what I see in yours."</p>
    <p>He hugged her tightly and began to cry.</p>
    <p>"We'll make this work. We'll be okay", Amelia whispered into his ear.</p>
    <p>The two sat embracing and pouring their hearts out all night. When dawn came gleaming up through the still open patio door, Amelia lay sleeping soundly as Worms stared at the ceiling.</p>
    <p>So he would leave. Plans would be made shortly for Virgil to take the Magpie into port and take on its old captain as Worms took leave of his duties in Silver Creek. There was still some time to go, and Worms began to count the days in the stars each night.</p>
