    Captain of the Sand

<body id = "welcome" >

    <p>The desert air was dry. In the cool of the night, weary souls breathed sighs of relief. A light, sand colored brick fortress beset the scene. It loomed above the surrounding encampments. Large sandstone towers at the corner of each wall reached 80 feet into the air. The keep too was an impressive sight. Ornamental crenelations peaked the battlements. The brickwork was exquisite; Truly remarkable in its construction by the renowned architects of the East. The courtyard before it held such beautiful and exotic plant life, the likes of which the attackers had never seen. The decorative gardens were marred regrettably with flakes of blood, debris and rubble. The earth had been torn up and cratered in places from trebuchets fired at the keep. The fortress was surrounded by hundreds of tents, men and siege equipment. Among the living were the arrow peppered dead and camels sullied with the blood of trampled foes. Riders patrolled still with polearms looking for stragglers.</p>
    <p>Fourteen weeks of sieging. One night of Rest. The battle was hard fought but Worms and his forces stood righteously victorious, draping the banners of the Stabbed Heart house over the rampart. In the throne room, Worms was losing his patience.</p>
    <p>Lord Dunrick's body slammed to the floor with a jaw clattering right hook.</p>
    <p>"Get him out of my sight" Worms spat. Two guardsmen left their rank and grabbed him by the arms.</p>
    <p>"You're fucking nothing, do you hear me?" yelled Lord Dunrick as the men heaved his shaggy form coldly out of the room. "The sea captain of some fuckin' sand in the fuckin' desert! You'll fuckin' regret this, Wolfe!" he continued to cry as he was dragged out the doors and around the corner.</p>
    <p>"And gag him" Worms called after the men. He turned, clenching his fists and furrowing his brow. He was livid. Part of him wanted to punch something, anything. He'd have taken his frustration out on Dunrick if he wasn't so valuable a prisoner.</p>
    <p>"We've won, sir", Virgil spoke softly but firmly behind Worms. "Let the regent take control of the administration here, and we can return to our camp. You haven't slept in two days", he reminded him, "You need this."</p>
    <p>Worms reached his boiling point and before bursting, he cooled. He breathed out slowly and tensely, but sincerely, his fists unfurled.</p>
    <p>"Tell the Stabbed Heart prince we've taken this castle and are turning it over to him", Worms stated, closing his eyes. "No prisoners are to be harmed and are to be considered under my own protection as prisoners of this campaign. If the Prince wants to sack and loot this place, so be it, but its inhabitants will not be touched. Understood?" Worms said.</p>
    <p>"Aye, sir, I'll inform the Prince" Virgil replied in kind and left briskly to turn command of the fortress over to their benefactor.</p>
