    <p>Virgil sat across from Worms in his quarters on board the Magpie. The weather this evening was hot and the pair had their shirts unbuttoned and mugs of wine in front of them. Virgil hunched over the desk studying a stack of papers intently while Worms lay back in his chair with his feet on his desk. He was peering hard at a small scroll.</p>
<p>"Why do they write these scrolls so small?" Worms asked, squinting at the scroll.</p>
<p>"I see them just fine, Sir" Virgil replied. Virgil lifted his head to observe his captain. "Have you ever had your eyes tested?" he quipped.</p>
<p>Worms placed the small scroll down and rubbed his eyes, leaning back further in his chair. </p>
<p>"I can read them they're just so small. Anyway, sounds like Forelance has spotted an Imperial fleet sailing Eastward. We should be clear of them but tell the bridge to keep an eye out" Worms explained. "How are the crew reports coming along?" </p>
<p>Virgil sighed. </p>
<p>"Same as the crew report last week" he began. "It's been three weeks at sea with no roster changes. We had three incidents of note, one drunk and disorderly, one late to shift without reason and one crew quarrel."</p>
<p>"Crew quarrel?" Worms asked, his ears perking up.</p>
<p>"I don't mean to point out the obvious, Worms. I advised against having one of the Eastern fishermen joining when we had another Dark Elf on board. Their culture is marred with slavery with my people being some of their favoured victims" Virgil said, his voice low, with a hint of upset.</p>
<p>Worms took his feet from the table and sat up.</p>
<p>"It's a long trip back to Wolves Port, Virgil." Worms spoke.</p>
<p>"We need capable men on board. I've never stopped anyone from any background, culture or race joining this crew. If you think there's going to be conflict between our personnel, I'm assinging you the duty of resolving it. As my quartermaster -" </p>
<p>Virgil cut him off. "I will remind both crew members of their obligation to operating and running this ship. But, Sir, this man comes from a land where my people get sold like cattle, where -"</p>
<p>"Did that fisherman buy and sell anyone?" Worms interrupted.  "Virgil I doubt he even made enough in those waters to feed his kids. I condemn slavery and I've fought with you to end it when we could but this man is not your enemy."</p>
<p>Virgil's eyes narrowed. </p>
<p>"Worms, this man's father may very well be someone who dealt in our trade. His brother, even his son, may have fought my people forcefully in the arenas along the Copper Coast. How can I be comfortable with that?" Virgil pleaded.</p>
<p>Worms furrowed his brow. "I'm disappointed in you, Commander. I will not let this man be mistreated or judged on this ship. The sins of the father or brother do not fall onto our man's shoulders and I will not be administering punishment to a man who has done our ship no wrong."</p>
<p>"Captain, I'm sorry I didnt-" Virgil began.
</p>
<p>"I think the crew reports can wait until tomorrow Virgil" said Worms, fixing the papers on the desk and looking away.
</p>
<p>"Aye, sir." Virgil stood and made his way to the doorway of the quarters.
</p>
<p>"And Commander?"
</p>
<p>Virgil turned back and looked at his captain.</p>
<p>"I don't think it's me you need to be apologising to,  don't you agree?"
</p>
<p>Virgil looked guilty. He couldn't bring himself to say anything else. He nodded and closed the door behind him.

</p>
<p>Worms slumped in his chair and ran a hand through his hair.
