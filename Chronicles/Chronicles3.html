    <p>Worms leaned over the railings of the deck. He was pensive and flipped a dagger in his hand as he gazed into the azure deep. The knife spun idly in his fingers until he caught his reflection in the blade. Who was he?</p>
    <p>Commander Virgil watched him for a while. 'Old habits die hard' he thought, and moved to console him. He walked up beside him and leaned over the railing and watched the waves trailing behind the Magpie. "You don't want to see them?" he asked  plainly.</p>
    <p>Worms continued to idly spin the knife in his hand, staring at it. Seeing his eyes, his scars and his swept hair every time the blade faced him. "I blame myself for everything. What happened to her father. What happeed to Silver Creek. What happened to her rule afterwards. What happened when the rebels came back. Marilyn probably won't even want to look at me. Will Chief Monroe even let me see Amy? What about.." he stopped.</p>
    <p>Virgil hesitated to place his hand on his friend's shoulder. He stopped short and let it fall back to the railing. His face was solemn. What the captain said was not necessarily wrong. He did have a remarkable role to play in Irrilithian history. He married the heir to the Saint Eden title in secret. Weapons he couried to the southern part of the island were used to rebel against the family. Worms took a leave of absence from his duties on board the Magpie, leaving Virgil to Captain in his stead until called upon again. Lord Saint Eden was murdered in a bloody battle and his daughter Amelia was brought to the throne in a time of turmoil. No one was ready for her rule. No one wanted an outsider and a mercenary to be her consort. Her consort, Worms, who supplied the weapons for the rebels. No one was content. When they rose up again and lay siege to the capital of the island, Silver Creek Landing, it was Worms who fled with one of his newborn twins, Ellie, in search of help. Naturally, when Virgil came with enough men to lift the siege and restore the Saint Eden rule, the harm was already done. Worms, devastated, left with Virgil to campaign in the East. To fight for the warlords and end a centuries old feud that wasn't even theirs; which led to a sustained conflict for three years. Many died, and many suffered. The crippling price to pay that ultimately brought stability and justice to the land. </p>
    <p>He reflected on this and tried not to give away his feelings. Worms was his dear friend. He was like a brother. They had both made mistakes. But it was undeniable. His captain was a good, but flawed man. He stared back to the waves, beating ceaselessly against the hull like the waves in his mind.</p>
    <p>Ages rolled. Eventually, Worms stopped playing with the knife. The final reflection caught him staring into his own eyes. He saw the scar under his left eyelid. He saw the years of pain inside himself. He saw a demon looking back at him.</p>
    <p>"Sooner or later Virgil, I'm going to have to face them." He said quietly. "I loved Amy. I will die for her if I have to. Those kids are more important to me than I think I can express."</p>
    <p>Virgil looked at his captain with sad eyes.</p>
    <p>"If anything happens to them, V" Worms began. He gulped hard and choked back a tear. "Will you take care of them for me?" He asked meekly.</p>
    <p>"I will", Virgil responded. He looked sincerely into his Captain's fragile eyes. They embraced.</p>
    <p>The sun sank. The waves were highlighted in orange and soon the world was plunged into darkness once more. Worms was alone in his quarters. He lay on his back, arms on his stomach and he stared at the ceiling. Candlelight flickered and cast mishapen shadows across his lonely walls. His prison for another night. Inescapable. He turned his head to the side and saw the same dagger beside a cup of water. He stared blankly and went back to looking at the ceiling. He grabbed the object beside him. With a long sigh he drew it to his chin. His hand slowly edging towards his neck. He exhaled.</p>
    <p>And took a long drink of water. He slammed the cup back onto the dresser and stared at the blade again. He knocked it off the dresser and watched it dance across the floor. The waves beat ever more harshly against the hull. He lay back down in a huff and slammed his eyes shut. Soon the night would be over. How then, would he hide his tears?</p>
    <p>Ages flew. Worms slept lightly. Outside the door from his quarters to the main deck, Virgil leaned quietly. His face was hidden by shadows cast in the pale moonlight. He listened intently to see if his Captain still stirred. He waited all night. He waited until morning.</p>
    <p>When Worms emerged the next morning, he seemed as if his sleep had still been restless. He opened quickly the door to the main deck and saw Virgil standing outside. "Sleep well, Commander?", Worms asked.</p>
    <p>"I did sir, and you?" he smiled.</p>
    <p>Worms nodded gently and smiled wearily. Virgil watched as Captain Worms Wolfe walked quietly to the bridge and took the wheel. Another night where they saw another morning.</p>
    <p>Another night endured.</p>
