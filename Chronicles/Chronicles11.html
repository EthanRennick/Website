<p>"I don't want us docked here more than a few hours. The less attention we draw, the better" Worms grumbled as the Ede pulled into the harbour of Wolves Port.</p>
<p>"Not happy to be home?" Virgil smiled.</p>
<p><i>'I pity the cursed who still call this place home',</i> Worms thought.</p>
<p>He scowled and shook his head. The air was putrid. Dead fish floated upon the surface of the dark green water below them. Virgil brough the ship steadily to a stop as crewmen moored the Ede. </p>
<p>"I'll gather some men, resupply the rations and water and we'll be on our way, Captain", Virgil explained.</p>
<p>Worms nodded and looked around in shame. The city had so much potential. He recoiled at the sights he saw. Beggars fishing with strings in the murky water. Rooves caving in on themselves. Moss and weeds overtaking the pathways. Boarded up windows and metal barrels with makeshift fires.</p>
<p>Worms ducked into his quarters and retrived a dagger from his desk, affixed it to his belt and returned to the bridge. </p>
<p>"Virgil, I can lead us through a safer route" he said, turning to his second officer, Scabbs. "Watch the ship and don't allow any one on board. There's no harbour masters so don't let anyone capitalise on our mooring."</p>
<p>Scabbs nodded and Virgil slung hus bow over his back. Worms rounded up a group of men and disembarked. Rotting timbers creaked under his feet as they walked along the pier to shore. He made his way along the dock to an algae ridden cobble stone jetty.</p>
<p>"Watch your step, boys." He warned as he led his party down a stairway into a tunnel in the jetty. Inside was flooded with sea water up to their ankles. The crewmen splashed through the dark tunnel, lighting a torch as they went.</p>
<p>The tunnel opened up to a larger passage, dimly lit by candles and strewn with stalls and impoverished characters skulking in the shadows.</p>
<p>"Is this really safer, Worms?" Virgil asked in a hush tone.</p>
<p>Worms peered around.</p>
<P>"There is, believe it or not, honour among these thieves. This guild looks like its going through a rough patch but they shouldn't attack an armed party of outsiders." he turned to Virgil and pointed down the passage. "I'm going to check this place out and see what I can find. There's an entrance to the Merchant sector down this passage. You can't miss it, its dead ahead" he explained.</P>
<p>"I'd be happier if we stuck together" Virgil stated. He eyes the passage curiously as it appeared more bright to him with his dark elf vision.</p>
<p>Worms waved him away and began walking in the opposite direction.</p>
<P>"Those are orders" he said over his shoulder, placing a hand on his dagger's sheath and pushing onward. Virgil shrugged and led the party to resupply. Worms wandered through the ratrun. Part of him was amazed how much it had not changed. He turned to ensure no one could see him anymore and ducked down a smaller passage way. His knees creeked as he explored the crumbling hallway.</P>
<p>With enough room to stand, he reached a small wooden door rotting off of its hinges and pushed inside. He lit a candle from his satchel and placed it on the floor inside.</p>

<p>Worms stood in the doorway of his old hideout. Somebody else had slummed there over the years. Still, the same kitchen, the same engravings of Mira's initials on the wall and the same dimly lit shadows brought him back to his days as a petty thief and scoundrel.
    He looked around with a frown. He realised how hopeless this place was. He finally realised how bad they had it. It was nothing compared to being free, it only took him until now to see it so clearly.
    A little part of him didn't budge. A Small part of him reminisced and wondered if he could have made it work. But that was once upon a time, it was for the best he thought as he shut the voice down.</p>

   <p>He lingered on standing in the doorway, never stepping inside. Grime and muck covered the old blood stains on the floor. The room had even moved on. Mira had moved on.</p> 
    <p>He leaned in the doorway fiddling with the dagger for a little longer. </p>
<p>
    <i>'It's time to go'</i> Worms thought, shutting his eyes to the scene. It was time to keep moving.
</p>
<p>He breathed a heavy sigh and slumped against the wall outside the room. Her dagger was by his side. He brought it from here to the college. He used it in the mutiny. He used it to rescue Virgil. He used it while sailing the Magpie. He kept it in his quarters in Silver Creek. He carried it with him while campaigning in the East. When the Magpie was shipwrecked, he retrieved it from his old quarters. He didn't let her go. He held onto it and knew it was worthwhile. It was a sign of how far he had come, and after all these years, he had come full circle.</p>
<p>A few moments passed and he turned to leave but paused. Decisively, he turned and blew out the candle before moving back through the hall to the passage. He looked around again with a new outlook. He followed the passage after Virgil.</p>
<p>Only the rats scurrying in the muck and lichen saw the lights reflect in the darkness. The shimmering glint of a blade in the dark and the glitter of a tear wiped from the Captain's eye.</p>
