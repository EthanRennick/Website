<p>Amelia slumped into the chair by the parlour's writing desk and ran a hand through her hair. She looked forward and caught a glimpse of her reflection in the mirror. She stared deeply at her own image. Her hand floated gently down by her side as she gazed emotionless at the mirror.</p>
<p><i>God</i>, she thought, as her eyes grew wider, <i>I'm just like him</i>.</p>
<p>She ran her hand through her long golden hair again. She rose wearily and entered her bedchamber from the parlour doors. They swung slowly behind her to a close. She walked onto the balcony and leaned over the wood beams to gaze at the stars.</p>
<p>As she closed her eyes in the chilly night air she could feel Worms' arms wrap around her. Her arms relaxed. Her tense muscles stopped straining and her gaze softened. For a few moments she felt at ease, and she wondered if he ever experienced the same thing.</p>
<p>Amelia let out a long breath. She had conquered another day. She had met with a representative of her government from one of the Southern cities, Port Sahna. A brief intermission for issuing her statement for Silver Creek Landing's ongoing neutrality in world affairs and ensuring her public's support. Then she planned with members of her small council on the expansion of the Weston farmlands and she raised the issue on new roads to develop for the mountain villages before winter set in. She spent the evening attending classes with the children. Ellie and Arthur were four now. Worms had been gone for almost two years. His absence created new challenges. It also solved several problems, admittedly, but she loved him too hard to hold him back from his heart's desires. <i>He was happy here, but I know he's happier out there</i> Amelia sighed.</p>
<p>She pulled her light cloak around her shoulders and turned inside. She shut the doors behind her and lay on her bed. She shut her eyes, took a deep breath and did not stir till morning.</p>

<p>The stars were high in the sky. On the bridge of the Magpie, Virgil stood stoically while a young Elven ensign held the wheel. A pale, older man approached and offered his spyglass to Virgil.</p>
<p>"What have you got, Joyce?" Virgil asked.</p>
<p>"Land ahead, Commander. Lighthouse. Silver Creek." Joyce replied. He pointed into the distance where small lights flickered.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Lieutenant. Take us in Ensign, nice and slow." said Virgil.</p>
<p>He fixed himself and walked down the stairs to the bridge to the mid deck. He knocked upon the Captain's door.</p>
<p>Inside Worms was sitting shirtless on the bed combing his hair. He had just washed it and was sifting through clothes to find his cleanest worn shirt. He pulled a black shirt with brown buttons over his long brown hair in attempt to match the black slacks he had scavenged. He rubbed his short beard into shape and approached the door.</p>
<p>"Virgil", he said perking up, "We must be on schedule?"</p>
<p>Virgil opened the door.</p>
<p>"Aye, Sir, we'll be in port before dawn."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Virgil. I'll meet you on the bridge shortly."</p>
<p>Virgil closed the door and returned to the wheel. Inside his quarters, Worms played with his beard trying to get the shape right. It seemed crooked. He grew frustrated. <i>She's not even going to notice.</i> He glanced down to his uncovered arm and the fresh bandage around it. <i>She's sure to notice that</i> he thought and he pulled his sleeves down. He peered into the dusty mirror by his bedside and pressed his finger against a scar on his cheek. <i>How did that happen? Right, Tel Kikrit, when those thugs jumped me outside Bravo's tavern.</i> He frowned at the red mark on his flesh and grabbed his sword belt from the table. He began to buckle it around his waist and hesitated. <i>You're overthinking, Worms</i> he thought to himself reassuringly.</p>
<p>He exited his quarters and approached Virgil on the deck. The wooden steps creaked beneath him as the waves gently brushed against the hull. Virgil eyed him curiously.</p>
<p>"Sword belt?" Virgil quipped.</p>
<p>Worms turned to look at his friend just to see him smirking in the lantern light. He smiled and shook his head. His fears and worries of the previous days seemed to drift away like a feather in the Irrilithian breeze. Truthfully, if a small part of him feared the reunion, every other part of him longed for it. He hoped, and knew, she felt the same.</p>
