    Forelance Retreat
</head>
<hr><p>Virgil knocked upon the captain's cabin door and waited for a reply. When none came, he opened the door slowly. Worms was caught in a moment of deep reflection. He looked up from his desk and glanced toward Virgil.</p><p>"Commander, I'm sorry, I was lost in thought," Worms quickly explained.</p><p>"I'm sorry to intrude, sir," Virgil said, closing the door behind him. He looked at Worms caringly. "Are you well, sir?"</p><p>"I'm fine Virgil, I'm—" he trailed off. "You just... You meet people once in a while, and though you only brush against their lives for but a moment, the impact they have... You meet them once, and never again. But you remember them. They're a part of you, a memory..." he gazed into nothingness before snapping back to reality. "Sorry, I was lost in thought. How soon to Forelance?"</p><p>"About half a day," Virgil began, "We should make it before the sun sets. With any luck, we'll have beaten the Imperial convoy to it." Virgil smiled. Worms smiled back. "Thank you, commander."</p><p>Virgil sailed the Ede into the bay of Forelance Retreat. The sky was beginning to darken. Time passed, and Worms reveled in life's glorious moments. He was thinking about his family, his friends and crew. He was thinking of the cities he'd visited and the seas he had sailed. The Ede was a vessel in which memories were made to live and die, yet, last forever.</p><p>Then Virgil slammed the door of the cabin. The stained glass window Worms envisioned of an idyllic life shattered. "Captain, you need to get out here, NOW!" Virgil cried.</p><p>Worms darted toward the door and flung it open. "Virgil, has something—" he started, then his face fell into a horrified realization. Before them lay the Imperial convoy amidst the wreckage of the stationed Free State fleet, sailing out of Forelance bay, flaming ballista firing into the smoke-filled town. Flame engulfed the air. Unearthly cries shrieked across the sea like haunting sirens beckoning death.</p><p>Across the deck of the ship, crewmen halted, their mouths agape and falling to their knees in terror of the apocalyptic scene before them. The monumental lighthouse of the city collapsed as its wooden frame succumbed to flames, crushing the market district and spreading like wildfire splinters and burning embers, hot like coal into the merchant's houses.</p><p>Worms shook his head. The Imperial convoy had beaten them. He helplessly watched as the convoy sailed out of the bay. Not a single arrow was fired to him. He was no longer worth it. The devastation showed how much the lives of the Free State meant to them. In the seas around them, dying sailors clung to the remnant of their broken hulls. Cries of help and mourning sounded around them, as the living clung to the floating dead.</p><p>"Ahead, full Virgil. Get to the town!" he barked, running to the sail to loosen them himself.</p><p>Virgil was slow to react. He backed up then came to his senses, sprinting to the wheel to take command. He spun the wheel to avoid the wreckage of a ship dead in the water engulfed in flame with corpses laying hazardously from its railings, arrows littered in their corpses.</p><p>Crewmen threw ropes overboard and lines to pick up sailors swimming toward the Ede. The port quickly approached as Worms and several crew men quickly hoisted the sail to slow speed. The bow of the Ede crashed into the port, and Worms sprinted toward the front of the ship and leaped into the docks. Several men followed, drawing swords, wary of Imperial soldiers that would be sifting through the town for people of interest, loot, grain or arms shipments.</p><p>Worms sprinted, but slowed. The cries and screams began to end as survivors began succumbing to exhaustion, flames, and smoke. That's when he saw his mark. Four Imperial soldiers sauntering through the town. Masks upon their faces hid their eyes and nose from the smoke; Monsters from a children's book that never should have been written.</p><p>Worms turned toward them. "You bastards!" he yelled with all his might, "What the fuck have you done!" As his party sprinted down the burning street, the Imperials swiftly turned their heels to face them.</p><p>Fueled by adrenaline Worms and his men advanced toward them. The Imperial soldiers stood dumbfounded as a flurry of crossbow bolts flew through the air. The bolts thudded into them, blood spurting from the wounds, downing two of them instantly. Another crew member wielding a spear charged toward the third soldier. The blade pierced his armor and impaled the soldier through the chest. The huge orc crew mate forced the soldier to the ground, pushing the polearm completely through the other side into the hot cobbled streets.</p><p>Worms drew his sword and aimed for the last one. He was upon him in a flash, with two hands driving his blade through this monster's stomach with such ferocity he lifted his enemy off his feet and threw him to the side. He pulled his sword out from the gaping wound and climbed on top of him, forcing his blade to the Imperial's neck.</p><p>A crewman pulled the mask from him, revealing the bitter face of the half-elf imperial soldier, his eyes bloodshot from stray fumes and blood looking in his mouth and down his cheeks. "Why have you done this?" Worms shouted, pushing the blade deeper against his neck.</p><p>The Imperial spat blood into Worms' face. "Fuck. You." spluttered the soldier. Worms gritted his teeth. "What have you done with the survivors? Where are your captives?" he asked, pushing deeper still with his blade, blood trickling onto it.</p><p>The Imperial smiled maniacally. "Free State survivors? There were no survivors."</p><p>Worms' eyes widened. "They're all dead?" he asked in shock.</p><p>"They're dead. You're dead. The Free State is dead," the Imperial said choking in his blood. Worms shook his head, his eyes staring directly into the man beneath him. He tensed fiercely, slicing his neck clean open. Blood poured and pooled around Worms' hands as he tossed the blade to the side and screamed into the air.</p><p>Thick black smoke billowed out of the houses on either side of the street. Burnt corpses clung to ashes of belongings as intense heat overcame the street. Cremated ceilings fell in on themselves across the town, sending splinters and debris and ash hurtling through the air. Crewmen began to cough and cover their mouths.</p><p>"They're all dead," Worms spoke softly in disbelief. "They're all dead."</p><p>Crewmen grabbed him by the shoulder and pulled him off the imperial's body. With blood in his hands, he was pulled down the street by his followers until he turned and began to move under his own volition back towards the docks. Virgil met them on the pier with several men preparing to disembark the Ede, ensuring the hulk had not been damaged when it had rammed toward the bay.</p><p>Virgil's face sunk as he saw his Captain jog helplessly his way. "Get us back onto the sea, Virgil. We need to help the men in the water," Worms panted, coughing up the smoke from his lungs.</p><p>"Worms, the town, what about the civilians?" he asked.</p><p>"They're dead," Worms said. "There were no survivors?"</p><p>Virgil asked, eyes widening. Worms looked at the floor, then raised his head and his eyes met Virgil's. He shook his head. "They're all dead," Worms said. "They're all dead."</p>
