<p>"Again," said Captain Monroe.</p><p>Worms' arms fell to his sides. His left arm ached from holding the bow, and his hand had been cut by the feathers of the arrows. He closed his eyes and grew frustrated with himself.</p><p>"You won't protect our Lady with aim like that.

He lowered the bow and squinted. He hit his mark. He glanced at Monroe and saw him smiling back.</p><body id = "welcome" >
