<p>Worms laid back in his chair. He couldn't relax. His mind was a chorus of voices, talking over the other. The night was silent at sea, but the sound was shattered by a knock on the door.</p><p>"Come," he clearly spoke, keeping his eyes shut against the world.</p><p>The handle shifted, and the door creaked open.</p><p>"I wanted to say that all was well at the bridge, sir, and we expect a quiet night," Worms heard Scabbs say.</p><p>"Thank you, Commander, goodnight," Worms replied.</p><p>"Goodnight, Captain," Scabbs replied.</p><p>Worms heard the door shut behind him. He took a deep shaky breath and loosened the collar on his uniform. In his mind, he was in another land far from the war, far from all aching memories and sorrows. It was a tranquil ocean, warm beaches, and songbirds above. Even in his imagination, he was plagued with solitude.</p><p>He winced to try to imagine who was around him. His family? His friends? His loyal crewmates? Every page turned in his mind was a flurry of pained, joyous, and blurry visions. Each page of the book of his life brought a smile and a frown.</p><p>He was on the cliff's edge of drifting into a slumber when another knock on the door came.</p><p>"Come," Worms called.</p><p>The handle shifted, and the door creaked open.</p><p>"Excuse me, Captain, I was told you were still awake. Might I bring you anything, Sir? Food or water?" the voice asked.</p><p>Worms recognized the voice of one of the kitchen staff employed on the ship.</p><p>"No thank you, Gundar, that will be all," Worms replied.</p><p>"Yes, sir," the voice responded, and the door shut again.</p><p>Quickly, it opened again.</p><p>"Apologies, sir. Goodnight, sir," the voice spoke quickly.</p><p>"Goodnight, Gundar, thank you again," Worms stated.</p><p>The door closed again. Worms swiveled in his chair and slid back into the back roads of his mind, coldly awaiting his haunting dreams.</p>
