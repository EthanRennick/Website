    <p>The evening sky was a low, amber haze and the inn on the promenade of Irrileth's capital, Silver Creek Landing, was full of merriment and laughter. Worms and his crew took up half the building and were drinking and eating enough to put the place out of business. Worms was at a round table in the corner surrounded by his officers and many of the crew. He was wearing his signature black shirt, black slacks and burgundy waistcoat. His dark brown hair was down and flowed beyond his shoulders. Every now and then he ran his hand through it or wiped some wine off of his short beard. Virgil, his dark elf Quartermaster, was sat beside him. He was in his darker leather armor and his famous bow was out of sight. Beside Virgil, was the Tiefling known as Atticus. Atticus sat with his light red skin and ram-like horns and was enjoying a sizeable flagon of ale. His dark hair was tied back in a short bun between his horns and his beige duster was thrown over the back of his chair. He smiled quite shyly at a young lady across the floor who had been watching the group all night, and she hid a smile of her own. Felix, the gnomish doctor and minor magic caster was no where to be seen. Already he had retired to the ship in the late hours of the night, missing much of the fun. Their ship, the Magpie, was moored in the harbour with a small skeleton crew on board for operations.</p>
    <p>"Next, there was the time I had to pull the Captain out of a cavern after the mine collapsed on us", Virgil laughed, raising his mug up high. Worms chuckled and held up his hands. "Yes, I still have the scar from when you fell and dropped me outside", he quipped, pointing to a small scar on his forehead. The younger crew members standing around the table let out hearty laughs at their Captain's stories. He was just like them. No nobility, no graces, no false pretenses. He was a good Captain and looked after them well, and they enjoyed working for him, whatever the job was.</p>
    <p>Atticus piped up next. "I also recall a time, dear commander, where I had to break you out of prison on the orders of our captain here", he said, gesturing to Virgil and glancing happily to Worms. "Now that doesn't count", Virgil smiled, pointing his finger at the tiefling. "If we start counting prison breaks then I have half a dozen more stories I can mention" Virgil grinned. His firm, yet well spoken voice, had a commanding tone to it but was calmmer than usual. Atticus' laughter trailed off as the crew started joking about all their close encounters, and he looked to his side over to the bar. The pretty young maiden was still there, serving drinks and food and sometimes glancing his way. As the night went on, he caught her folding her apron and begin to leave.</p>
    <p>"Folks, if you'll excuse me I'm going to turn in for the night" Atticus proclaimed to the table. Worms put his hand on his arm and looked concerned. "Atticus, Atticus, if you leave now who's going to pay the tab" he said, and burst out with laughter falling back into his chair. Atticus smiled at the joke and put on his duster and headed out the door. He saw the barmaid someway down the promenade and caught up with her.</p>
    <p>"Excuse me, miss", he began, "I don't mean to be too forward but.." and he hesitated. 'What if she didn't like Tieflings', he thought briefly. "Go ahead", she smiled understandingly. "Breath!" she laughed, pushing him gently in the arm. He breathed a sigh of relief. "Would you mind if I walked you home?", he asked timidly. She took his hand gently. "It would be a pleasure, sir" she smiled, and they began walking by the seafront with the waves lapping softly as they strolled.</p>
    <p>Back in the inn, the hour grew later. The moon was rising now and many of Silver Creek's usual residents had turned in. They left this party of mercenaries and couriers to their drink. The crew were celebrating a large shipment they had made of armor and arms to the island's souther most city, Port Sah'Nah. It was an old city, with large sea walls and a beautiful harbour. Most shipping to the island came to this harbour and was delivered to Silver Creek by land or sea thereafter. The crew were paid handsomely and now they were spending several days in the capital for shore leave.</p>
    <p>Worms was several drinks in but had his wits about him as several more members of the crew took their leave and made off for other inns or to fall into their hammocks in the Magpie. Worms and Virgil were soon only sparsely surrounded by groups of their crew, and as the moon rose higher, a lull came over the inn, replacing the waves of noise earlier. Worms reached for the bottle of wine he had been drinking and poured the ends into his glass. He clumsily left it down onto the table and raised the glass upward.</p>
    <p>In a sadder tone than he had been previously expressing, he spoke to Virgil. "There are some people that come to mind that are not with us today, V. The likes of which we shall never meet again." Virgil nodded. "It's saddening to think, sir, isn't it?" he replied. Worms nodded affirmatively back, and he recollected the people they had left behind along the way. </p>
    <p>Mira from his childhood had likely found her own people in the Shattered Glass Isles by now. Thalmann, who he had met on the way to the college, now a distant memory. Even the admirals he had studied under and rebelled against, many had died in the time since. The dozens of crew members that had fallen in the line of duty or had absconded and left the crew vulnerable or hurt. Several faces flashed before him, and he came back to his senses.</p>
    <p>"This next drink shall be for them, V" he stated, downing half the glass swiftly. Virgil took a hard swig of his own ale and looked drowsily toward his captain. "There'll be more like them, Worms. The risk has always been worth it. To live a full life, knowing you will encounter others who won't be there at the end", virgil mumbled. He staggered to his feet.</p>
    <p>"Captain, I do believe it is time to sleep. I shall see you tomorrow", he slurred, and began to make his way somewhat slowly out of the inn and to the promenade. Worms sat in silence for a few minutes, sipping the rest of his wine and reflecting on life. The road he had travelled to get here was wrought with pain, lessons and happiness. Whatever lay ahead, he thought, was no match for him and his crew. He stood up, leaving the empty bottle and ensuring his sword was still in its sheathe, and promptly exited the inn.</p>
    <p>The night was quite cold, and in his foggy mind he damned himself for not bringing a cloak.</p>
