    Laid To Rest

<body id = "welcome" > 
    <p>The Magpie was anchored off the coast of a small, nameless island. The crew were gathered together some way up the shoreline, outside a sheltered cove. Penn's body lay on a wooden pyre.</p>
    <p>Virgil leaned forward to say something into his captain's ear. The dark elf was in his darkened leather armor. He had combed his hair and his short beard was trimmed. His slight frown gave away much of the feelings he was trying to hide.</p>
    <p>"Would you like to say a few words, Sir?" he asked in a whisper.</p>
    <p>Worms ran his hand through his dark brown hair and stepped forward, looking at the body of his friend being laid to rest before him. Worms was wearing his 'dress' uniform. He wore a black shirt and hemmed black slacks. Over this was his wine waistcoat. He had opted not to wear his rapier on his belt today.</p>
    <p>Members of the crew looked toward him. Many looking stoic and apathetic. Though it must be said, an elven ensign was weeping, and she caught Worms' eye. She had only been on board a few months. Just before the end of the campaign in the East. She fought as hard as the other men, and though she had an emotional side, she was valued. Now, more pressingly, she was a friend of the deceased.</p>
    <p>As Worms looked at the solemn faces, he spoke up.</p>
    <p>"Friends..", he began, trailing off. "We all know how much Penn brought into our lives," and he gulped hard. "He was our friend, a crew mate, a fighter, a navigator. He added glimmers of brightness into each of our lives. The likes of which we won't see again."</p>
    <p>The elven lady sniffled and her eyes welled up. Tears collected at the bottom lids of her eyes and she turned to take comfort in Atticus' shoulder. The tiefling embraced her, putting one arm around her head, and gesturing for Worms to continue with the other.</p>
    <p>"For those of you who don't know," Worms continued, "Penn had been a friend of mine since I met him at the college."</p>
    <p>He remembered fondly when they broke out of dorms in the night, and raced to the harbour, and stole a barrel of fish that the other students fried and cooked. There was havoc the next day to find the culprit, and everyone covered the story up. He smiled and his eyes instinctively shut as he explored the pathways of his memory, then after a few happy breaths he shed a tear.</p>
    <p>He brushed it away subtly.</p>
    <p>"I was very fond of Penn, as he was of the ship and all of you. He will be dearly remembered, and his ashes will be returned to his family in Marble Falls, upon our return to the Free State," he spoke calmly.</p>
    <p>A round of scattered Cheers and Ayes were given and the crew lined up to say their final goodbyes to the dwarfs body. Worms turned back to Virgil, away from his suboordinates and buried his head in his hands.</p>
    <p>"I hate doing this Virgil, I just hate it," he said, shaking his head side to side.</p>
    <p>"I'm sorry, Worms, I know you were close friends," Virgil replied. He looked at the ground where he had been digging the toe of his boot into the dirt. His boot was scuffed, and he looked at the clump of dirt as if it was the only thing that didn't upset him that day.</p>
    <p>"I'll be able to continue the service, Sir," Virgil spoke lowly, "it isn't any trouble."</p>
    <p>Worms smiled and put his hand on Virgil's shoulder, nodding kindly to his taller friend. He looked back as the members of their mercenary band paid their respects to their fallen comrade. Penn's stab wounds had been covered neatly by the ships doctor and the dwarf looked quite well. He had a slight smirk, which was typical of him, and several people noted it. His grey beard had been plaited and one of the Eastern crew members had painted Penn's family sigil onto a piece of carved wood and placed it at his feet. The man was loved. The man was respected. It was a peaceful ceremony, and he'd have liked it.</p>
    <p>Worms slipped away and Virgil began reading the Captain's last rites in his place. He didn't do it often, but the loss of Penn had hit him hard. A senseless mugging, after a life well lived, and he succumbed to his wounds three days into the journey back to Irrileth. It broke his heart frankly.</p>
    <p>He wandered through the dunes of the beach, strolling aimlessly and thinking of him.</p>
    <p>That night, the crew had gotten back to the ship offshore, and began their voyage back to Irrileth. Worms retired from his day shift in command at the weel, into his quarters. He sat on the edge of the bed, and slumped. He loosened the top of his shirt and took a moment to sit and try clear his head. A knock came at his cabin door.</p>
    <p>"Come," Worms called.</p>
    <p>Atticus opened the door. He had left his dress uniform in his own cabin and now wore a long robe patched with scraps of leather over his tunic and hemp pants. In the candlelight, Atticus' burgundy skin and ram-like horns cast a demonic shadow over the cabin's wooden walls. He stepped lightly in and closed the door quietly behind him. Worms perked up.</p>
    <p>"Everything alright Atticus?" he asked caringly. It was unusual for anyone to come to his quarters, except for Virgil, or one of their more pompous passengers if they felt the privileged desire to.</p>
    <p>"Fine, fine, Sir, stay seated" he said nonchalantly and waved at his leader to stay where he was. He walked slowly and lightly forward, taking a seat at the table near the bed and turning to face Worms. "I wanted to see if you were alright", he said.</p>
    <p>Worms began to shrug his shoulders and dropped them.</p>
    <p>"I'm doing my best, lieutenant, thank you for asking." Worms said in appreciation.</p>
    <p>Atticus, not satisfied, asked again.</p>
    <p>"Are you alright, Worms?"</p>
    <p>Worms was taken aback. He wasn't good with expressing his feelings. He liked order. He liked logic. He liked respect and he was often times unable to effectively convey these feelings to others. Now he was being addressed, not as a superior, but by a friend; a good friend.</p>
    <p>He shook his head, and sharply turned his head to look at the ceiling, the wall, anywhere but Atticus' brown eyes.</p>
    <p>He tried to speak, but his voice cracked as he raised his hands to try and explain how he felt.</p>
    <p>"At the dunes today, I just.." he began, staring at the corner of the room, "I wished I had told him how much I cared for him."</p>
    <p>Atticus looked at Worms helplessly as the man broke down.</p>
    <p>"I.." Worms tried again. "I wish I had told him how much his friendship meant to me." He began to cry softly.</p>
    <p>"And I hope that when he died, he knew that. He was a stained glass window of everyone he had ever met and everything he had achieved. He deserved to die peacefully at home." </p>
    <p>"Do you think he knew, Atticus?" Worms asked. "Do you think he knew we all.. loved him?"</p>
    <p>Atticus got up and went to sit by his friend's side on the bed. He placed an arm around Worms and held his shoulder.</p>
    <p>"Penn stayed as long as he did, not because he was broke or liked the ocean or liked travelling, but because of you, his friends, and how well he was treated. I know for a fact he considered it a pleasure and an honor to know you, and serve you, Worms", Atticus reassured him.</p>
    <p>Worms nodded, pursing his lips, and rubbing his face with his hands.
    <p>Atticus symapthised with him.</p>
    <p>"It is the mark of a good captain to share the load, sir. We're all here. We're all going to mourn. And we'd all appreciate if you mourned with us now" he said.</p>
    <p>"I wish I had known him longer, Atticus," Worms said regaining his composure. "I do. But I am grateful to have known the man. I won't forget him."</p>
    <p>Atticus stayed with him a little longer, sitting in silence. He got up to leave and return to bed himself. </p>
    <p>"Atticus?" Worms called, before his confidant left the room.</p>
    <p>"Yes, sir?" he replied.</p>
    <p>"The island wasn't named, was it?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"Not as I'm aware" Atticus said, a bit caught off guard by the question.</p>
    <p>"Mark it in the maps, will you? 'Penn Island'. We'll make sure other ports we dock in get the same charters," he smiled slightly.</p>
    <p>Atticus smiled back. A way for the world to remember the man who always worked to make it better.</p>
    <p>"I'll enter it into the ship's maps tomorrow. Goodnight, sir," Atticus smiled, and he left the captain alone.</p>
    <p>An hour later and Worms lay in bed staring at the ceiling, replaying scenarios in his head and guilt tripping himself over why he hadn't been there to protect Penn. A senseless mugging over whatever was in his coin pouch, by a drunken bum in the port of Tel Kikrit. As Penn reeled from his wounds in the burning sun and crawled through the sandy streets of the city, he must have felt abandoned, surely. 'Surely..?' Worms thought. It ate him up inside, and he hardly slept a wink.</p>
    <p>Soon, they'd be landing in Silver Creek to resupply in friendly ports. His family would be there. That was a whole new battle indeed.</p>
