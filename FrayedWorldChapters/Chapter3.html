    <p>The chill in the air worsened as Worms and Thalmann scaled the cliffside. It was mid day and the wind seemed to
        whip around their
        feet and was growing stronger. Thalmann was a natural climber - a dwarf from Marble Falls, the last dwarven
        bastion on the continent beset upon a marble mountain rangew with crystal clear waters. Yet, even still, this
        coastal storm was beyond him. Worms was completely out of his depth. He had ridden a horse once or twice, scaled
        several buildings and was quite athletic. Mountain climbing was new to this street urchin, and he found it
        daunting. The pair were huddled in their cloaks and moved steadily through the crags and escarpment. On
        occasion, they would need to help each other over a particularly steep piece of exposed rock. Thalmann's height
        didn't necessarily benefit them but he was strong and capable.

    <p>In the early evening, Worms was climbing an embankment surrounded by trees in a sheltered area desperate to catch
        a glimpse of the college. By now he had been on the road for two weeks, with an additional two days travel along
        side Thalmann, and he was tired. As Thalmann attempted to start a fire, Worms looked across a vast canvas of
        reds, greens, browns and greys as the autumnal trees fell to the still green grass and contrasted with the
        jagged peaks which surrounded them in their basin. There in the distance, a great but almost crumbling stone
        tower stood erect on top a hill. It's conical roof and surrounding farmland was the unmistakable lighthouse of
        the college. Worms had seen paintings of it before back in Wolves Port. He even stole on or two of them too for
        a pretty penny. Worms sighed internally. Surely this ruin was just a mockery, and the real grand lighthouse was
        just beyond? Though it looked impressive, it was somewhat underwhelming. Worms barely made out a lone slate
        falling
        to the ground and he watched as it plummeted to the ground and promptly smash. With only about ten miles to go
        and with
        half a day until the impending storm, he felt a sense of optimism slowly reassure him once again.

    <p>"Thalmann!", Worms called, "I see it in the distance. We're almost there!". Worms smiled with relief and looked
        towards the dwarf. His leather armor was getting scuffed but was still in fine shape. Thalmann let the sticks he
        was carrying drop to his feet and began to jog towards Worms, up the embankment. He stood beside the human and
        placed a hand on his back. "We did it, Laddy. Our new home. Our future" he spoke. Worms caught a gleam in
        Thalmann's eye of the same optimism that he had felt moments before. His words rang like a bell in his mind,
        echoing. "Our new home. Our future." If Worms had given it much thought, he could have easily falling into a
        trance pondering his path here and the road still ahead, but instead he gleefully jogged down the bank and stood
        near the makeshift camp. With rain on the way, the fire would not be of much use, but could survive if they kept
        it close to a rockface out of the rain's down. And so the pair prepared for nightfall.</p>
