    <p>The chill in the air worsened as Worms and Thalman scaled the cliffside. It was mid day and the wind seemed to
        whip around their
        feet and was growing stronger. Thalman was a natural climber - a dwarf from Marble Falls, the last dwarven
        bastion on the continent beset upon a marble mountain range with crystal clear waters. Yet, even still, this
        coastal storm was beyond him. Worms was completely out of his depth. He had ridden a horse once or twice, scaled
        several buildings and was quite athletic. Mountain climbing was new to this street urchin, and he found it
        daunting. The pair were huddled in their cloaks and moved steadily through the crags and escarpment. On
        occasion, they would need to help each other over a particularly steep piece of exposed rock. Thalman's height
        didn't necessarily benefit them but he was strong and capable.
    </p>
    <p>In the early evening, Worms was climbing an embankment surrounded by trees in a sheltered area desperate to catch
        a glimpse of the college. By now he had been on the road for two weeks, with Thalman, and he was tired. As his dwarven friend attempted to start a fire,
        Worms looked across a vast canvas of
        reds, greens, browns and greys as the autumnal trees fell to the still green grass and contrasted with the
        jagged peaks which surrounded them in the mountain basin. There in the distance, a tall but almost crumbling stone
        tower stood erect on top a steep cliff. Its conical roof and surrounding busy farmland was the unmistakable lighthouse of
        the college. Worms had seen paintings of it before back in Wolves Port. He even stole one or two of them for
        a pretty penny. Worms sighed internally. Surely this ruin was just a mockery, and the real grand lighthouse was
        just beyond? The paintings had done the site an injustice, glorifying this excuse for a monument. To the eager Worms, it was somewhat underwhelming.
        Still, he figured there was only a few miles left of their journey now. He'd met men who made the same trip before, back in Wolves Port.
        Once they reached the lighthouse, they'd be able to get a wagon to the college proper.
        With a day or so until the next storm, he felt a sense of optimism slowly reassure him once again.
    </p>

    <p>"Thalman!", Worms called, "I see it in the distance. We're almost there!". Worms grinned with relief and looked
        towards the dwarf. His leather armor was getting scuffed but was still in fine shape. Thalman let the sticks he
        was carrying drop to his feet and began to jog towards Worms, up the embankment. He stood beside the human and
        placed a hand on his back. "We did it, Laddy. Our new home. Our future" he spoke. Worms caught a gleam in
        Thalman's eye of the same optimism that he had felt moments before. His words rang like a bell in his mind,
        echoing. "Our new home. Our future." If Worms had given it much thought, he could have easily fallen into a
        trance pondering his path here and the road still ahead, but instead he cheerfully jogged down the bank and stood
        near the makeshift camp. With rain on the way, the fire would not be of much use, but would survive if they kept
        it close to a rockface out of the rain's downpour. And so the pair prepared for nightfall.</p>

    <p>The men sat close to each other, backs to the wind and rain as a rabbit roasted over the small fire. It was the happiest they had seen each other since they met two weeks ago.
        Since then they'd faced fierce challenges from wildlife and weather. Now they were close to their destination and they relished the thought.
