<body id = "welcome"> 
    <p>Worms Wolfe darted through the back streets of Wolves Port. With the agility of a bird, he ducked behind one door and flew down a series of stairs and rat runs, as two human guards ran amok in the streets above. It was a dirty, rat-ridden city, with old stone walls and a large gate sitting between two towering hills. The houses and buildings inside were a mesh of timber and stone; although many were in dire need of maintenance and the others were discarded and forgotten. The harbour was falling apart, with rotten walkways and docks barely being held together by underpaid dwarven and human workers. The murky water of the port was dirty green, and several fishermen starved to death daily in its midst. Worms was one of the lucky ones. He was healthy enough to do whatever was necessary to stay living, and he was smart enough to know when something was worth it or not.</p>

    <p>Eventually, he slowed to a gentle pace. He kept his hood up, hiding his long dark hair which swooped below his shoulders under his cloak, navigating the dimly lit underworld of the dying city. His shirt was black, just like the rags he called trousers. His brow dripped with sweat from his near escape. Small droplets rolled down his cheeks into his tightly trimmed beard, and he regularly clutched at one of his sleeves as if his arm ached. In his hands he carried a small wooden box which would keep him and his partner fed for a short time. His footsteps on the damp floor were light, as he moved over them quietly in worn out brown leather shoes. At irregular intervals he would pass shady looking traders with their makeshift stalls, or beggars who were unable to walk, holding out their hands desperate for respite. But this wasn’t the kind of place where respite was readily available. There weren’t many places like that in the Free State. With a hint of remorse, he went on his way through the dark passages, shortly arriving to a smaller tunnel which he had to stoop his head to travel down. He wasn’t tall per se, standing at five foot eight, but these tunnels weren’t made with comfort in mind. When he reached the end of the tunnel, he pushed open the small wooden door and the tunnel lit up brightly. He stepped into the large room and locked the door behind him. He heard a small rustling noise and the sound of falling cutlery, followed by an angry “Damn!”. A small head poked around the corner, and a blade glistened in the torch light, as Worms’ partner jumped to defend herself. The figure breathed a sigh of relief when they saw who the visitor was and moved into the light, folding their arms and cocking their head.</p>

    <p>In front of Worms stood a smaller orcish girl dressed in rags and leather, with short, black braided hair that stopped just above her shoulder blades. This was Mirak Reygor, his partner and crime and only friend in the city. She was thin, but not underweight, and her teeth were sharpened to fangs. She was still holding the knife she had grabbed moments before, and gestured towards Worms with it. “You said you’d be back an hour ago”, she said sternly. Worms smiled guiltily and set the box down on a crate before taking off his cloak and hanging it on the door. “The port guards gave me some trouble when breaking out of the Merchant’s quarters. I had to lose them before coming back.” he explained. He walked over to a pile of straw and furs on the floor, and was going to lie down before the girl stopped him. “Come on,” she said sadly, “I have to redress your arm.” and she pulled him back to his feet. “Mira, it’ll be fine, it feels better-” he began to protest, but to no avail. Mira rolled up the sleeve of his shirt to reveal a shoddy looking bandage that was soaked to a dark red. She grimaced, and started to unwrap it slowly. Worms shut his eyes and gritted his teeth, as the cloth pulled parts of his skin and dried blood off the wound. “I don’t care what Phraan says, I’m taking the next job, and if he doesn’t like it he can find another pair of lackeys”, she said with scorn. Worms sighed. Phraan was a councilman in the city and had a hand in most of the city’s affairs. He was only a poor corrupt official though, and had a party of thugs to carry out his underhanded, off-record projects. Worms and Mira were inducted into that party two years ago, when they were desperate and impressionable. Throughout that time, they had stolen, bribed and even killed for the man. It kept them alive and fed, and it kept Phraan in a position of power. It was working for now, but one slip up and that was it. They walked on very thin ice. They were up to their necks, and the only way out was through.</p>

    <p>“When this job is completed, Mira, we won’t have to worry about Phraan. That box buys him the key to the city and buys us our freedom. When I deliver it to the drop-off and get the payment, we can buy ourselves passage to Forelance, Silver Creek, anywhere we want!” he said hopefully. But there was a looming sense of doubt in Mira’s mind. This wasn’t the first time she had heard that. She knew deep down that neither of them believed it. She frowned as she redressed the stab wound in Worms’ left arm, and when she finished she moved back to the kitchen. She felt a hand on her back as she broke down into tears over the counter. Worms could do nothing but listen to her gentle sobs, and reflect on how they both ended up here. An orphan and an outcast. Two more unwanted rats in a den of thieves. “I’m sick of it, Worms”, Mira said softly. “I’m sick of living here. I’m sick of Phraan’s games and I’m sick of worrying to death about you every time you leave this room.”</p>

    <p>The life he had promised her wasn’t what she was living. The truth was, he was powerless to make a meaningful change. He too was tired of making ends meet. Months ago, he had considered a job at the College of Sailing. It was a place for men with no other place to turn to. He’d be left with impossible debts and servitude, and where would Mira go? That was no place for her and he couldn’t leave her. He looked to the ceiling as he let a few tears fall and hit his dirty shirt. He knew she was thinking of returning home back to where she belonged; Back to the orcs of the Shattered Glass Isles. There, far in the West, she would be taken in and find work with her own people. But for now, they were together, and that’s how he wanted it to stay. They sat in silence for what felt like hours, as he draped his arm around her and held her close, fixing her hair back in place. He knew she wasn’t angry, just hurt. “Whatever it is that you’re thinking Mira…”, he began, “I’m with you all the way.” He waited a long time for her to speak, until he realised her silence was her reply.</p>

    <p>The next day he delivered the box to the drop-off point. He walked silently like a mouse through the bustling slums until he reached a stone door set in an archway. He knocked upon it three times and after a short wait, it was slowly pulled open. A gaunt looking high elf stood behind the door. His skin was deathly pale, and his eyes were sunken and red. “Phraan’s package?”, he spoke in a low raspy voice. Worms retrieved the box from his satchel, and held it out on display for the elf. He watched closely as the elf took hold of the box and cracked the lid open. The elf chuckled. “This is what he’s been so desperate for?” the elf said, throwing a quick glance towards a solemn looking Worms. The elf stared him down, maybe looking for a break in character, or a slight flaw in the delivery that he could fault him on. But Worms stared blankly ahead, and awaited his payment as he did so many times before. The elf smirked and disappeared for a moment, coming back with a small grey back of coins, thrusting it into his fellow underling’s hands. “I’ll put in a good word for you, Wolfe. Keep working like this and maybe you’ll take my position sometime” he smiled maliciously, closing the door briskly after him.</p>

    <p>Worms wandered home with a great deal on his mind. He was thinking about Phraan and thinking about the law. He was thinking of Mira, the only family he held dear. He guessed their paths were crossed for far too long. He was thinking of the Free State, and wondered how it ever became independent. Returning home to find Mira gone was the only thing that made him cry. All that was left was a short note and her dagger. A reason for leaving, and a reason to come back to him someday. He broke down in the kitchen and cried where she did the night before. He didn’t know when they’d ever be fit to be together again. When would he ever travel so far West to the Shattered Glass Isles, and would he even be welcomed there? One week later his heart was made up. He packed his things and left the city under the cover of darkness. He hoped she would be safe without him. His path lay East towards the college, and the trip would be harder for her than for him. Still, he doubted he would ever find something worthwhile without her.</p>
