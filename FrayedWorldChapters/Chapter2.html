<body id="welcome">
    <p>A thin plume of smoke rose through the bronze canopy of the woodland between Wolves Port and The College. It was
        mid-autumn. The air was cold, and had a bite to it. The crisp of the morning was prolonged to the afternoon. The
        cloudy skies blocked sunlight from heating the soil, leaving it frigid and hard. The elevated position on the
        side of the mountain made the site significantly more open to the elements. Waves bashed against the nearby cliffside,
        and the sea showed no sign of calming.</p>

    <p>Worms shivered as he walked back to his camp. He flung a small hare onto the ground and shook off his damp cloak.
        He threw it on a fallen log beside his small fire then dug around in his rucksack and pulled out a second cloak Mira
        had given him a year ago. It was light brown and frayed, but it gave him a sense of security knowing a part of
        her was with him. He was quite happy with his catch. The hare was small, white, and its fur would keep at
        least one limb warm, he thought. He was by no means a skilled hunter, but he had set traps in Wolves Port to
        catch rodents on occasion; a somewhat meagre meal, but life was like that in the slums of the Port. He began
        skinning the small creature with one of the daggers he had brought on the journey with him. He travelled
        light, not having many belongings to bring with him when he left his home, and he took only what he thought
        would help. His arm ached. He hadn’t changed the dressing for two days and he knew Mira would be mad. It was a
        dirty stab from a dirty card cheater, but he was tolerating the pain. He finished skinning the hare, peeling the last of
        its fur off and swiftly gutted it. Worms stuck the creature on a stick and left it to rest on the fire. The meat
        would hopefully last him long enough to traverse the mountain pass between Wolves Port and The College.</p>

    <p>He decided to take this day to rest. He had been travelling by day and sleeping at night for 6 days and he was
        tired. He rolled up his sleeve and started to unravel the bandage covering his wound. It had been eleven days since
        he got into the fight with the swindler, and though he won the skirmish, this would leave an everlasting
        reminder to check his corners. While he cleaned and redressed the wound, the fire crackled, and somewhere off in
        the distance, he hoped Mira was somewhere thinking of him too. It was then he felt something sharp press to the
        back of his neck.</p>

    <p>“You needn’t think of getting up, human”, spoke a voice, a little high pitched but with a ferocity behind it. He
        used human as if an insult. Worms’ eyes widened, and he slowly began to raise his arms. “You can tell Phraan I’m
        dead”, Worms bargained. “I’ll give you whatever you need.” He shut his eyes, fearing the worst. The phantom
        behind him shifted, and began to walk around to face Worms. Hearing movement, Worms cracked an eye to see a
        short but stocky looking figure shuffling in front of him. They were about four feet high, with a gruff, short
        beard and black braided hair that seemed to reach beyond their back. Their dusty leather armour was contrasted
        by an ornate looking blue leather chest piece, which showed a large white mountain in the middle. The man
        appeared at least half dwarven, but what he was doing out in the wild, Worms could only begin to imagine.</p>

    <p>“You must’ve been an awful bother to this Phraan fellow, whoever he is, eh, Laddy?”, the dwarf quipped, lowering
        his small battle axe from Worms’ head, but still keeping a steady grip on it. “I never tried to be, but
        sometimes enough is enough..” Worms spoke softly, looking to the ground. This seemed to make the dwarf hesitate
        somewhat. He cocked his head, sizing up his larger opponent. ‘Scrawny looking thing’, he thought to himself,
        expecting a hostile reaction from the wild man. Then, he relented.</p>

    <p>“So you’re out here on the run, eh young’un?”, the dwarf remarked, finally letting his axe head rest on the
        ground. He threw a look around the camp too, investigating the fire, and ensuring he wasn’t being flanked. Worms
        sighed, and nodded. “For a few days now”, he admitted, taking his seat again. “I don’t want any trouble.” The
        dwarf cracked a smile. “No one ever does, Laddy! But you’ll freeze out here you know.” Worms was confident in
        his ability to reach the college safely. He knew it was to the East, over the mountains, and probably on the
        coast. Though now, as he rolled this idea around in his mind, some self doubt trickled in and his expression
        fell blank as he considered he may be lost.</p>

    <p>The dwarf picked up on this, seeing Worms’ eyes begin to dart around too. Although he was caught off guard, Worms
        didn’t want to let this dwarf gain a stronger upper hand. “I suppose you don’t want to tell me why you’re out
        here, dwarf?”, he questioned. The dwarven man smirked, and knew the kid would was no push over. He eyed the
        young wanderer suspiciously. “That’s not something you need to know, Laddy” he replied back. They both looked at
        each other cautiously, and the tension between them burned as the mutual distrust seemed to grow larger. Worms
        readied to reach for a dagger, as the dwarf’s eyes narrowed. Just when both anticipated a fight, the howl of a
        wolf sounded in the distance. The two men turned their attention from each other to a fighting stance with their
        eyes on the edge of the surrounding woods.</p>

    <p>“They must smell the meat.” Worms suggested, and raised Mira’s dagger in defence. The dwarf nodded, and raised
        his axe. Without a moment to prepare, two wolves darted out of the tree line and sprinted towards their dinner.
        Worms gulped and prepared to catch one wolf with a stab before it reached him, while the dwarf stood firm,
        raising his axe before bringing it down on his opponent. A loud crack emerged from the Wolf’s skull as it split,
        and the beast fell to the ground in front of the dwarf. As Worms glanced sideways in astonishment at the dwarf’s
        proficiency, the second beast was too struck down, as the dwarf brought his axe in an upward swing, preventing
        the wolf from attacking the younger traveller. As the beast yelped and squirmed on the ground, reeling from the
        dwarf’s blow, Worms dashed forward and finished it off with a cut to the neck.</p>

    <p>The pair stood back to back, slowly circling the camp, expecting another attack. A wolf and two more of his pack
        stood on a ledge overlooking the scene, before turning around, and leaving their fallen comrades to their fate.
        Less than a minute later, the dwarf sighed and lowered his weapon. “I think that’s it Laddy, the rest seem to
        have run off”. Worms, still a little shocked, let out the breath of air he seemed to be holding in. “Thalman.
        Thalman Katal.” said the dwarf, and reached out a hand to his new companion. Worms reached out and shook it.
        “Worms Reygor Wolfe”, he spoke, “I’m from Wolves Port.” Thalman smiled gently. There were many in the Free State
        without family. Those without lineage or a family name often took the name of the city they grew up in. Their
        was a whole orphanage in the south which he had heard of, where every child took the same last name,
        ‘Forelance’. Realising this young wanderer was on his own, just as he was, brought a slight warmth to his heart.
    </p>

    <p>The two settled into the camp and continued to talk throughout the day. It was approaching the night, and the
        fire roared, when Thalman piped up. “What’s your destination, Worms? Why don’t you tell me where you’re
        heading.” Worms shuffled and dug his foot into the ground. “I think I’m heading to the College of Sailing,
        though I can't be sure what awaits me there.” Thalman paused for a moment in thought. “No one ever knows what
        the future will hold, Laddy, except for those with magic in their veins..”, he spoke softly. His slightly high
        pitched voice was almost melodic in a way. “I think I’ll be heading there myself. We ought to travel together”
        Thalman told Worms. Worms grinned. “That would be a welcome change. I’d appreciate someone watching my back.”
        The pair shook hands again, and shortly after, they both headed to sleep beside the fire.</p>

    <p>When dawn broke, Worms arose from the cloak he slept on. The morning was colder than yesterday, and clouds
        gathered above. Thalman shook his head.“I’m afraid more bad weather's on the way, Worms. Brewing still, but not far off. The sooner we make it around the mountains, the more
        likely we are to get shelter.” Thalman called from the other side of the camp. He was packing his things with
        surprising swiftness. Worms gazed to the sky as he packed, figuring the storm was maybe two days off still. As
        the pair set off around the coast of the Free State, they both had a sense of renewal, and Worms didn’t feel as
        lonely. Still carrying Mira in his heart, he pushed forward. Though wary of the journey ahead, he intended to
        see it through; With a friend by his side or otherwise. Yet he still wandered, was Thalman the friend he
        appeared to be?</p>
