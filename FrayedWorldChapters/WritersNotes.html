        <p>This is a fictional series that I just so happened to name today, the 27th of April 2020. It’s been in my head in many different forms, one way or another. Sometimes as plot lines or story arcs, other times as characters exploring this world and then later tying into other characters. However, it almost always came down to one character; Worms Wolfe. A rugged ship’s captain with a mysterious past who makes his way as a mercenary and courier, with the help of his crew. This one character allowed me to explore aspects of the world I hadn’t even thought of yet.</p>
        <p>By using this character as a vessel, I was able to play with different ideas and scenarios, interact with other characters or get involved in world affairs. What was once my childhood ‘Original Character’ became a whole world with complex political rivalries, sordid romances, deep backstories and an array of characters each with their own personalities, feelings and loyalties. I’d act out scenarios in my head, or write letters posing as a character writing to another. I’d spend nights scribbling in my notebook, describing someone and jot down phrases or sayings on the side of my school books. It became a way of escaping from a mundane life in the countryside to a richer world where anything could happen.</p>
        <p>A lot of friends have encouraged me to write these things down so that they’re never lost. Whether its a continent, or one conversation, everything I think of in this world is important to me and I’ve finally taken their advice and created this site. Whether I’m the only one that ever reads this or not, I hope this site can become a haven for my ideas.</p>
