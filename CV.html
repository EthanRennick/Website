            Kildare Town Community School, Kildare — Leaving Certificate<br>

        <h3>Experience</h3>
            <h4>Craft Shows - Annually</h4>
                I occasionally help friends and family run their stands at craft shows within the county. I was responsible for processing transactions, <br>
                encouraging sales and tending to customer’s needs. This has helped me develop Communication Skills and self-confidence.<br>

            <h4>Music Events  - Annually</h4>
                I perform by playing guitar and singing songs for “The Community Gathering” each Christmas. I also partake in performances for other <br>
                local events. This has helped further developed my Interpersonal Skills. <br>

            <h4>John Paul II Initiative - August 2017 - August 2018</h4>
                I completed “The Pope John Paul II Award Programme” in my local diocese. I worked with other young adults from our community and parish.<br>
                This voluntary work included a trip to Lourdes; where I was responsible for caring for elderly and sick pilgrims.<br>
                I often played guitar for each event and performed each evening in the hotel lobby. This improved my ability to work with <br>
                people from various backgrounds. It also helped further my Aural Skills as listening to the elderly pilgrims’ needs was of<br>
                utmost importance.<br>

        <h3>AWARDS & ACHIEVEMENTS</h3>
            <h4>John Paul II:</h4>
                I received the Papal Cross award for my consistent involvement in the local community and parish. <br>
                It is the highest award available within the John Paul II program. Below this, I've obtained their Gold Medal too.<br>
            <h4> 6th year student:</h4>
                I was nominated by teachers for the Inspirational 6th Year Student Award, which is a Maynooth University Award <br>
                given to a single student in a school.<br>
            <h4>Mental Health Committee Member:</h4>
                My role as a member of the mental health committee was to aid in the emotional well being of students within the school. <br>
                As a leader I would issue surveys to get an overall consensus on what issues were affecting the student’s mental health. <br>
                The committee would discuss these issues and how best to tackle them. It was my job as a leader to negotiate a solution <br>
                that suited all Year Heads, committee members and students alike.<br>
            <h4>Student Council Member:</h4>
                I was responsible for listening to the concerns of students from various years. <br>
                My goal was to voice those concerns to management within the school in order to bring change that would <br>
                ultimately benefit the student’s mental health and academic performance<br>
                <hr>

        <h3>SKILLS</h3>
