        A sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller which generates stories by simulating psychology, <br>
        ecology, gunplay, melee combat, climate, biomes, diplomacy, interpersonal relationships, art, medicine, trade, and more.<br>
        <br>
        In this game, you manage a small group of colonists who crash land on a far away, inhabited world on the outer rim.<br>
        You need to grow food, manage colonists' health and happiness, defend your home from enemies, trade and form relationships with other factions!<br>
        Your colonists have personalities too. They form relationships and have mental and physical health.<br>
        Several times in my games, a warrior has broken up with their lover to date the doctor who just saved their life and had a mental breakdown when the doctor rejects them.<br>
        There are high points and low points. The randomly generated story and event systems creates a unique and beautiful story of love and loss in each game.<br>
        Threats can be minor; A group of beavers eating your timber. Auroras can pass over your colony. Space debris landing in your camp.<br>
        Threats can be big; A blight which will kill your crops over time. A plague which affects your colonists. Uncovering valuable treasure in a cave.<br>
        Threats can be game changing; A huge swarm of mechs terrorising you. A nuclear fallout settling in your area. A trade caravan which gets ambushed, so you lose your colonists.<br>

        <h2>Ethan's Favourite Rimworld Memory</h2>
        My favourite memory is a colony I started in a mountainside. I had an android colonist who rented rooms and food to passing traders and mercenaries. <br>
        The colony started growing into a town and eventually a city with so much power, influence and wealth.<br>
        Eventually, I got a notification. It told me a hive of giant man-eating bugs had started to inhabit a nearby cave in our mountain. I thought it was fineee.<br>
        I thought the hive was far enough away that it would never affect my colony. I thought everything would be fine. I was so wrong.<br>
        What started off as one hive of five bugs became over 30 hives with literally hundreds of man eating bugs. As they multiplied, so did the size they occupied.<br>
        After two in game years, they had mined out the whole mountainside. They had caused so many rock-falls and were close to breaking into my fridge, which was in the mountain.<br><br>
        I had a weapon to call an orbital bombardment to a location. I created an Android colonists from scrap and called him TOM. <br>
        TOM's purpose was to take the bombardment device, walk to the cave of bugs and throw the device through the door I had built to keep them in.<br>
        When TOM opened the door, he was instantly incapacitated by bugs, havings his limbs torn off by the horde. The orbital bombardment was called and obliterated the side of the cave.<br>
        TOM the android, merely a few hours old, gave his life trying to destroy the horde. Instead, he unleashed it. <br><br>
        The bugs poured out through the gap. There were so many. Literally hundreds of bugs. They immediately broke through my front line of turrets, trenches and barbed wire.<br>
        They over ran the city almost instantly. Within minutes, 80% of my colonists had been murdered and eaten. The rest of them jumped in a boat and had to completely abandon the city I had built.<br>
        I could never return, because we did not have the strength to retake our home. We settled somewhere else and were able to survive, but it was never the same.<br>
        Two years later, one colonist returned by land. At this point, the city had been levelled. There was nothing left but man-eating bugs. <br>

        <br>
        It was one of the most devestating, amazing and memorable moments in my history of gaming. One hive of bugs which I dismissed became my devestating downfall.<br>

        I recommend it wholeheartedly.<br>
